<h2><i>FOREWORD</i></h2>


<p><i>These are the ideas that I have aimed to
set forth in this tale.</i></p>

<p><i>1st. That although an animal is much
helped by its mother's teaching, it owes still
more to the racial teaching, which is instinct,
and can make a success of life without
its mothers guidance, if only it can live
through the dangerous time of infancy and
early life.</i></p>

<p><i>2d. Animals often are tempted into immorality&mdash;by
which I mean, any habit or
practice that would in its final working,
tend to destroy the race. Nature has rigorous
ways of dealing with such.</i></p>

<p><i>3d. Animals, like ourselves, must maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
ceaseless war against insect parasites&mdash;or
perish.</i></p>

<p><i>4th. In the nut forests of America, practically
every tree was planted by the Graysquirrel,
or its kin. No squirrels, no nut-trees.</i></p>

<p><i>These are the motive thoughts behind my
woodland novel. I hope I have presented
them convincingly; if not, I hope at least
you have been entertained by the romance.</i></p>

<h2><i>THE FOUNDLING</i></h2>




<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE FOUNDLING</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="113" height="112" alt=""/>
</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>IT was a rugged old tree
standing sturdy and big
among the slender second-growth.
The woodmen had
spared it because it was
too gnarled and too difficult for them to
handle. But the Woodpecker, and a host
of wood-folk that look to the Woodpecker
for lodgings, had marked and used it for
many years. Its every cranny and borehole
was inhabited by some quaint elfin
of the woods; the biggest hollow of all,
just below the first limb, had done duty
for two families of the Flickers who first
made it, and now was the homing hole of
a mother Graysquirrel.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<div class="image-left"><img src="images/i_004.jpg" width="187" height="181" alt="" />
</div>

<p>She appeared to have no mate; at least
none was seen. No doubt the outlaw
gunners could have told a tale, had they
cared to admit that they went gunning
in springtime; and now the widow was
doing the best she could by her family in
the big gnarled tree. All went well for a
while, then one day, in haste maybe,
she broke an old rule in Squirreldom;
she climbed her nesting tree openly, instead
of going up its neighbor, and then
crossing to the den by way of the overhead
branches. The farm boy who saw
it, gave a little yelp of savage triumph;
his caveman nature broke out. Clubs
and stones were lying near, the whirling
end of a stick picked off the mother Squirrel
as she tried to escape with a little one
in her mouth. Had he killed two dangerous
enemies the boy could not have
yelled louder. Then up the tree he
climbed and found in the nest two living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
young ones. With these in his pocket he
descended. When on the ground he
found that one was dead, crushed in
climbing down. Thus only one little
Squirrel was left alive, only one of the
family that he had seen, the harmless
mother and two helpless, harmless little
ones dead in his hands.</p>

<div class="image-right"><img src="images/i_005.jpg" width="203" height="221" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Why? What good did it do him to
destroy all this beautiful wild life? He
did not know. He did not think of it
at all. He had yielded only to the wild
ancestral instinct to kill, when came a
chance to kill, for we must remember
that when that instinct was implanted,
wild animals were either terrible enemies
or food that must be got at any price.</p>

<p>The excitement over, the boy looked
at the helpless squirming thing in his
hand, and a surge of remorse came on
him. He could not feed it; it must die
of hunger. He wished that he knew of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
some other nest into which he might put
it. He drifted back to the barn. The
mew of a young Kitten caught his ear.
He went to the manger. Here was the
old Cat with the one Kitten that had
been left her of her brood born two days
back. Remembrance of many Field-mice,
Chipmunks and some Squirrels killed by
that old green-eyed huntress, struck a
painful note. Yes! No matter what he
did, the old Cat would surely get, kill,
and eat the orphan Squirrel.</p>

<p>Then he yielded to a sudden impulse
and said: "Here it is, eat it now." He
dropped the little stranger into the nest
beside the Kitten. The Cat turned toward
it, smelled it suspiciously once or
twice, then licked its back, picked it up in
her mouth, and tucked it under her arm,
where half an hour later the boy found
it taking dinner alongside its new-found
foster-brother, while the motherly old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Cat leaned back with chin in air, half-closed
eyes and purring the happy, contented
purr of mother pride. Now, indeed,
the future of the Foundling was
assured.</p>

</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>LITTLE Graycoat developed
much faster than his Kitten
foster-brother. The spirit of
play was rampant in him, he
would scramble up his mother's
leg a score of times a day, clinging on
with teeth, arms and claws, then mount
her back and frisk along to climb her upright
tail; and when his weight was too
much, down the tail would droop, and he
would go merrily sliding off the tip to
rush to her legs and climb and toboggan
off again. The Kitten never learned the
trick. But it seemed to amuse the Cat
almost as much as it did the Squirrelet,
and she showed an amazing partiality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
for the lively, long-tailed Foundling. So
did others of importance, men and women
folk of the farmhouse, and neighbors
too. The frisky Graycoat grew up amid
experiences foreign to his tastes, and of a
kind unknown to his race.</div>

<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_012.jpg" width="218" height="214" alt="Bannertail being carried by cat" />
</div>

<p>The Kitten too grew up, and in midsummer
was carried off to a distant farmhouse
to be "their cat."</p>


<p>Now the Squirrel was over half-grown,
and his tail was broadening out into a
great banner of buff with silver tips.
His life was with the old Cat; his food
was partly from her dish. But many
things there were to eat that delighted
him, and that pleased her not. There
was corn in the barn, and chicken-feed
in the yard, and fruit in the garden.
Well-fed and protected, he grew big and
handsome, bigger and handsomer than
his wild brothers, so the house-folk said.
But of that he knew nothing; he had never
seen his own people. The memory of his
mother had faded out. So far as he
knew, he was only a bushy-tailed Cat.
But inside was an inheritance of instincts,
as well as of blood and bone, that would
surely take control and send him herding,
if they happened near, with those and
those alone of the blowsy silver tails.</p>

<p>There was a growing, murmuring sound,
then smoke from the barn, like that he
had seen coming from the red mystery in
the cook-house. But this grew very fast
and huge; men came running, horses frantically
plunging hurried out, and other
living things and doings that he did not
understand. Then when the sun was
high a blackened smoking pile there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
where once had stood the dear old barn;
and a new strange feeling over all. The
old Cat disappeared. A few days more
and the house-folk, too, were gone. The
place was deserted, himself a wildwood
roving Squirrel, quite alone, without a
trace of Squirrel training, such as example
of the old ones gives, unequipped,
unaccompanied, unprepared for the life-fight,
except that he had a perfect body,
and in his soul enthroned, the many deep
and dominating instincts of his race.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE NEW AND LONELY LIFE</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="109" height="110" alt=""/>
</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THE break was made complete
by the Red Horror,
and the going of the man-people.
Fences and buildings
are good for some
things, but the tall timber of the distant
wooded hill was calling to him and though
he came back many a time to the garden
while there yet was fruit, and to the field
while the corn was standing, he was ever
more in the timber and less in the open.</div>

<p>Food there was in abundance now, for
it was early autumn; and who was to be
his guide in this: "What to eat, what to
let alone?" These two guides he had,
and they proved enough: <i>instinct</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
wisdom inherited from his forebears, and
his keen, discriminating <i>nose</i>.</p>

<p>Scrambling up a rotten stub one day,
a flake of bark fell off, and here a-row
were three white grubs; fat, rounded,
juicy. It was instinct bade him seize
them, and it was smell that justified the
order; then which, it is hard to say, told
him to reject the strong brown nippers
at one end of each prize. That day he
learned to pry off flakes of bark for the
rich foodstuffs lodged behind.</p>

<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_022.jpg" width="112" height="235" alt="caterpillars" />
</div>

<p>At another time, when he worked off a
slab of bark in hopes of a meal, he found
only a long brown millipede. Its smell
was earthy but strange, its many legs and
its warning feelers, uncanny. The smell-guide
seemed in doubt, but the inborn
warden said: "Beware, touch it not." He
hung back watching askance, as the evil
thing, distilling its strange pestilent gas,
wormed Snake-like out of sight, and Bannertail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
in a moment had formed a habit
that was of his race, and that lasted all
his life. Yea, longer, for he passed it on&mdash;this:
Let the hundred-leggers alone.
Are they not of a fearsome poison race?</p>
<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_023.jpg" width="192" height="247" alt="catkins" />
</div>

<p>Thus he grew daily in the ways of
woodlore. He learned that the gum-drops
on the wounded bark of the black
birch are good to eat, and the little faded
brown umbrella in the woods is the sign
that it has a white cucumber in its underground
cellar; that the wild bees'
nests have honey in them, and grubs as
good as honey; but beware, for the bee
has a sting! He learned that the little
rag-bundle babies hanging from vine and
twig, contain some sort of a mushy shell-covered
creature that is amazingly good
to eat; that the little green apples that
grow on the oaks are not acorns, and are
yet toothsome morsels of the lighter sort,
while nearly every bush in the woods at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
autumn now had strings of berries whose
pulp was good to eat and whose single
inside seed was as sweet as any nut.
Thus he was learning woodcraft, and
grew and prospered, for outside of sundry
Redsquirrels and Chipmunks there were
few competitors for this generous giving
of the Woods.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="109" height="110" alt=""/>
</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THERE are certain stages of
growth that are marked by
changes which, if not sudden,
are for a time very
quick, and the big change
in Bannertail, which took place just as
he gave up the tricks and habits learned
from his Cat-folk, and began to be truly
a Squirrel, was marked by the fluffing of
his tail. Always long and long-haired, it
was a poor wisp of a thing until the coming
of the Hunting-moon. Then the hairs
grew out longer and became plumy, then
the tail muscles swelled and worked with
power. Then, too, he began a habit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
fluffing out that full and flaunting plume
every few minutes. Once or twice a day
he combed it, and ever he was most careful
to keep it out of wet or dirt. His coat
might be stained with juice of fruit or
gum of pine, and little he cared; but the
moment a pine drop or a bit of stick,
moss, or mud clung to his tail he stopped
all other work to lick, clean, comb, shake,
fluff and double-fluff that precious, beautiful
member to its perfect fulness, lightness,
and plumy breadth.</div>



<p>Why? What the trunk is to the elephant
and the paw to the monkey, the
tail is to the Graysquirrel. It is his special
gift, a vital part of his outfit, the
secret of his life. The 'possum's tail is
to swing by, the fox's tail for a blanket
wrap, but the Squirrel's tail is a parachute,
a "land-easy"; with that in perfect
trim he can fall from any height in
any tree and be sure of this, that he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
land with ease and lightness, and on his
feet.</p>

<p>This thing Bannertail knew without
learning it. It was implanted, not by
what he saw in Kitten days, or in the
woods about, but by the great All-Mother,
who had builded up his athlete
form and blessed him with an inner
Guide.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE FIRST NUT CROP</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="109" height="110" alt=""/>
</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THAT year the nut crop was a
failure. This was the off-year
for the red oaks; they
bear only every other season.
The white oaks had
been nipped by a late frost. The beech-trees
were very scarce, and the chestnuts
were gone&mdash;the blight had taken them
all. Pignut hickories were not plentiful,
and the very best of all, the sweet shag-hickory,
had suffered like the white oaks.</div>

<p>October, the time of the nut harvest,
came. Dry leaves were drifting to the
ground, and occasional "thumps" told of
big fat nuts that also were falling, sometimes
of themselves and sometimes cut
by harvesters; for, although no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Graysquirrel was to be seen, Bannertail
was not alone. A pair of Redsquirrels
was there and half a dozen Chipmunks
searching about for the scattering precious
nuts.</p>

<div><img src="images/i_034a.jpg" alt="squirrels" width="127" height="247" class="split" /></div>
<div><img src="images/i_034b.jpg" alt="squirrels" width="304" height="177" class="split" /></div>

<p>Their methods were very different from
those of the Graysquirrel race. The
Chipmunks were carrying off the prizes
in their cheek-pouches to underground
storehouses. The Redsquirrels were hurrying
away with their loads to distant
hollow trees, a day's gathering in one
tree. The Graysquirrels' way is different.
With them each nut is buried in
the ground, three or four inches deep, one
nut at each place. A very precise essential
instinct it is that regulates this plan.
It is inwrought with the very making of
the Graysquirrel race. Yet in Bannertail
it was scarcely functioning at all.
Even the strongest inherited habit needs
a starter.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>How does a young chicken learn to
peck? It has a strong inborn readiness
to do it, but we know that that impulse
must be stimulated at first by seeing the
mother peck, or it will not function. In
an incubator it is necessary to have a
sophisticated chicken as a leader, or the
chickens of the machine foster-mother
will die, not knowing how to feed. Nevertheless,
the instinct is so strong that a
trifle will arouse it to take control. Yes,
so small a trifle as tapping on the incubator
floor with a pencil-point will tear
the flimsy veil, break the restraining bond
and set the life-preserving instinct free.</p>

<p>Like this chicken, robbed of its birthright
by interfering man, was Bannertail
in his blind yielding to a vague desire to
hide the nuts. He had never seen it
done, the example of the other nut-gatherers
was not helpful&mdash;was bewildering,
indeed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Confused between the inborn impulse
and the outside stimulus of example,
Bannertail would seize a nut, strip off the
husk, and hide it quickly anywhere.
Some nuts he would thrust under bits
of brush or tufts of grass; some he buried
by dropping leaves and rubbish over
them, and a few, toward the end, he hid
by digging a shallow hole. But the real,
well-directed, energetic instinct to hide
nut after nut, burying them three good
inches, an arm's length, underground, was
far from being aroused, was even hindered
by seeing the Redsquirrels and the
Chipmunks about him bearing away
their stores, without attempting to bury
them at all.</p>
<div class="image-right"><img src="images/i_037.jpg" width="155" height="262" alt="Squirrel Bye" />
</div>
<p>So the poor, skimpy harvest was gathered.
What was not carried off was
hidden by the trees themselves under a
layer of dead and fallen leaves.</p>

<p>High above, in an old red oak, Bannertail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
found a place where a broken limb
had let the weather in, so the tree was
rotted. Digging out the soft wood left
an ample cave, which he gnawed and garnished
into a warm and weather-proof
home.</p>

<p>The bright, sharp days of autumn
passed. The leaves were on the ground
throughout the woods in noisy dryness
and lavish superabundance. The summer
birds had gone, and the Chipmunk,
oversensitive to the crispness of the
mornings, had bowed sedately on November
1, had said his last "good-by," and
had gone to sleep. Thus one more voice
was hushed, the feeling of the woods
was "<i>Hush, be still!</i>"&mdash;was all-expectant
of some new event, that the tentacles
of high-strung wood-folk sensed and
appraised as sinister. Backward they
shrank, to hide away and wait.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SUN SONG OF BANNERTAIL</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="109" height="110" alt=""/>
</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>
THE sun was rising in a
rosy mist, and glinting the
dew-wet overlimbs, as there
rang across the bright bare
stretch of woodland a loud
"<i>Qua, qua, qua, quaaaaaaa!</i>" Like a high
priest of the sun on the topmost peak of
the temple stood Bannertail, carried away
by a new-born inner urge. A full-grown
wildwood Graysquirrel he was now, the
call of the woods had claimed him, and
he hailed the glory of the east with an
ever longer "<i>Qua, qua, quaaaaaaaaaa!</i>"</div>

<p>This was the season of the shortest
days, though no snow had come as yet to
cover the brown-leaved earth. Few birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
were left of the summer merrymakers.
The Crow, the Nuthatch, the Chickadee,
and the Woodwale alone were there, and
the sharp tang of the frost-bit air was
holding back their sun-up calls. But Bannertail,
a big Graysquirrel now, found
gladness in the light, intensified, it
seemed, by the very lateness of its coming.</p>
<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="191" height="310" alt="bird on side of tree" />
</div>
<p>"<i>Qua, qua, qua, quaaaaaa</i>," he sang,
and done into speech of man the song
said: "<i>Hip, hip, hip, hurrahhh!</i>"</p>



<p>He had risen from his bed in the hollow
oak to meet and greet it. He was
full of lusty life now, and daily better
loved his life. "<i>Qua, qua, qua, quaaaa!</i>"&mdash;he
poured it out again and again. The
Chickadee quit his bug hunt for a moment
to throw back his head and shout: "<i>Me,
too!</i>" The Nuthatch, wrong end up, answered
in a low, nasal tone: "<i>Hear, hear,
hear!</i>" Even the sulky Crow joined in at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
last with a "<i>'Rah, 'rah, 'rah!</i>" and the
Woodwale beat a long tattoo.</p>

<p>"<i>Hip, hip, hip, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!</i>"
shouted Bannertail as the all-blessed
glory rose clear above the eastern
trees and the world was aflood with the
Sun-God's golden smile.</p>

<p>A score of times had he thus sung and
whip-lashed his tail, and sung again, exulting,
when far away, among the noises
made by birds, was a low "<i>Qua, quaaa!</i>"&mdash;the
voice of another Graysquirrel!</p>

<p>His kind was all too scarce in Jersey-land,
and yet another would not necessarily
be a friend; but in the delicate
meaningful modulations of sound so accurately
sensed by the Squirrel's keen ear,
this far-off "<i>Qua, qua</i>," was a little softer
than his own, a little higher-pitched, a
little more gently modulated, and Bannertail
knew without a moment's guessing.
"Yes, it was a Graysquirrel, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
was not one that would take the war-path
against him."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 310px;">
<img src="images/i_044.jpg" width="310" height="159" alt="squirrel jumping" />
</div>

<p>The distant voice replied no more, and
Bannertail set about foraging for his
morning meal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;">
<img src="images/i_045.jpg" width="333" height="122" alt="Squirrel eating" />
</div>

<p>The oak-tree in which he had slept was
only one of the half-a-dozen beds he now
claimed. It was a red oak, therefore its
acorns were of poor quality; and it was
on the edge of the woods. The best
feeding-grounds were some distance away,
but the road to them well known. Although
so much at home in the trees,
Bannertail travelled on the ground when
going to a distance. Down the great
trunk, across an open space to a stump,
a pause on the stump to fluff his tail and
look around, a few bounds to a fence,
then along the top of that in three-foot
hops till he came to the gap; six feet across
this gap, and he took the flying leap with
pride, remembering how, not so long ago,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
he used perforce to drop to the ground
and amble to the other post. He was
making for the white oak and hickory
groves; but his keen nose brought him
the message of a big red acorn under the
leaves. He scratched it out and smelled
it&mdash;yes, good. He ripped off the shell
and here, ensconced in the middle, was a
fat white grub, just as good as the nut
itself, or better. So Bannertail had grub
on the half-shell and nuts on the side for
his first course. Then he set about nosing
for hidden hickory-nuts; few and
scarce were they. He had not found one
when a growing racket announced the
curse-beast of the woods, a self-hunting
dog. Clatter, crash, among the dry leaves
and brush, it came, yelping with noisy,
senseless stupidity when it found a track
that seemed faintly fresh. Bannertail
went quietly up a near elm-tree, keeping
the trunk between himself and the beast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
From the elm he swung to a basswood,
and finished his meal of basswood buds.
Keeping one eye on the beast, he
scrambled to an open platform nest that
he had made a month ago, where he lazed
in the sun, still keeping eyes and ears
alert for tidings from the disturber below.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 180px;">
<img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="180" height="277" alt="squirrel on back in fork of tree branches" />

</div>
<p>The huge brute prowled around and
found the fresh scent up the elm, and
barked at it, too, but of course he was
barking up the wrong tree, and presently
went off. Bannertail watched him with
some faint amusement, then at last went
rippling down the trunk and through the
woods like a cork going down a rushing
stream.</p>



<p>He was travelling homeward by the
familiar route, on the ground, in undulated
bounds, with pauses at each high
lookout, when again the alarm of enemies
reached him&mdash;a dog, sniffing and
barking, and farther off a hunter. Bannertail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
made for the nearest big tree, and
up that he went, keeping ever the trunk
between. Then came the dog&mdash;a Squirrel
Hound&mdash;and found the track and yelped.
Up near the top was a "dray," or platform
nest, one Bannertail had used and
partly built, and in this he stretched out
contentedly, peering over the edge at the
ugly brutes below. The dog kept yelping
up the trunk, saying plainly: "<i>Squirrel,
squirrel, squirrel, up, up, up!</i>" And
the hunter came and craned his neck till
it was cricked, but nothing he saw to
shoot at. Then he did what a hunter
often does. He sent a charge of shot
through the nest that was in plain view.
There were some heavy twigs in its make-up,
and it rested on a massive fork, or the
event might have gone hard with Bannertail.
The timber received most of the
shock of the shot, but a something went
stinging through his ear tip that stuck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
beyond the rim. It hurt and scared
him, and he was divided between the
impulse to rush forth and seek other
shelter, and the instinct to lie absolutely
still. Fortunately he lay still, and the
hunter passed on, leaving the Squirrel
wiser in several ways, for now he knew
the danger of the dray when gunners
came and the wisdom of "lay low" when
in doubt.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE COLD SLEEP</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_n.jpg" width="115" height="117" alt=""/>
</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NEXT day there was a driving
storm of snow, and whether
the sun came up or not
Bannertail did not know.
He kept his nest, and, falling
back on an ancient spend-time of the
folk he kins with, he curled up into a
sleep that deepened with the cold. This
is partly a deliberate sleep. The animal
voluntarily lets go, knowing that life outside
is unattractive; he, by an act of the
will, induces the cold sleep, that is like
a chapter of forgetfulness, with neither
hunger nor desire, and after it is over,
no pain in punishment or remorse.</div>

<p>For two days the storm raged, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
when the white flakes ceased to pile upon
the hills and trees, a cutting blast arose
that sent snow-horses riding across the
fields and piled them up in drifts along
the fences.</p>

<p>It made life harder for the Squirrel-Folk
by hiding good Mother Earth from their
hungry eyes; but in one way the wind
served them, for it swept the snow from
all the limbs that served the tree-folk as
an over-way.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 281px;">
<img src="images/i_053.jpg" width="281" height="81" alt="Nuts with crown above them" />
</div>
<p>For two days the blizzard hissed. The
third day it was very cold; on the fourth
day Bannertail peeped forth on the
changed white world. The wind, the
pest of wild life in the trees, had ceased,
the sky was clear, and the sun was shining
in a weak, uncertain way. It evoked
no enthusiasm in the Graycoat's soul.
Not once did he utter his Sun-salute. He
was stiff and sleepy, and a little hungry as
he went forth. His hunger grew with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
exercise of moving. Had he been capable
of such thought he might have said:
"Thank goodness the wind has swept
the snow from the branches." He galloped
and bounded from one high over-way
to another, till a wide gap between
tree-tops compelled him to descend.
Over the broad forest floor of shining
white he leaped, and made for the beloved
hickory grove. Pine-cones furnish
food, so do buds of elm and flower-buds
of maple. Red acorns are bitter yet eatable,
white acorns still better, and chestnuts
and beechnuts delicious, but the
crowning glory of a chosen feast is nuts
of the big shag hickory&mdash;so hard of shell
that only the strongest chisel teeth can
reach them, so precious that nature locks
them up in a strong-box of stone, enwrapped
in a sole-leather case; so sought
after, that none of them escape the hungry
creatures of the wood for winter use,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
except such as they themselves have
hidden for just such times. Bannertail
quartered the surface of the snow among
the silent bare-limbed trees, sniffing, sniffing,
alert for the faintest whiff.</p>
<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_054.jpg" width="171" height="216" alt="squirrel digging" />
</div>
<p>A hound would not have found it&mdash;his
nose is trained for other game. Bannertail
stopped, swung his keen "divining-rod,"
advanced a few hops, moved
this way and that, then at the point of
the most alluring whiff, he began to dig
down, down through the snow.</p>



<p>Soon he was out of sight, for here the
drift was nearly two feet deep. But he
kept on, then his busy hind feet replacing
the front ones as diggers for a time,
sent flying out on the white surface brown
leaves, then black loam. Nothing showed
but his tail and little jets of leaf-mould.
His whole arm's-length into the frosty
ground did he dig, allured by an ever-growing
rich aroma. At last he seized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and dragged forth in his teeth a big fat
hickory-nut, one buried by himself last
fall, and, bounding with rippling tail up
a tree to a safe perch that was man-high
from the ground, he sawed the shell
adroitly and feasted on the choicest food
that is known to the Squirrel kind.</p>

<p>A second prowl and treasure-hunt produced
another nut, a third produced an
acorn, a visit to the familiar ever-unfrozen
spring quenched his thirst, and then back
he undulated through the woods and over
the snow to his cosey castle in the oak.</p>

</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>OTHER days were much like
this as the Snow-moon
slowly passed. But one
there was that claimed a
place in his memory for
long. He had gone farther afield to
another grove of hickories, and was digging
down so deep into the snow that caution
compelled him to come out and look
around at intervals. It was well he did so,
for a flash of brown and white appeared
on a near log. It made toward him, and
Bannertail got an instinctive sense of
fear. Small though it was, smaller than
himself, the diabolic fire in its close-set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
eyes gave him a thrill of terror. He felt
that his only safety lay in flight.</div>

<p>Now it was a race for the tall timber,
and a close one, but Bannertail's hops
were six feet long; his legs went faster
than the eye could see. The deep snow
was harder on him than on his ferocious
enemy, but he reached the great rugged
trunk of an oak, and up that, gaining
a little. The Weasel followed close behind,
up, up, to the topmost limbs, and
out on a long, level branch to leap for the
next tree. Bannertail could leap farther
than Fire-eyes, but then he was heavier
and had to leap from where the twigs were
thicker. So Fire-eyes, having only half
as far to go, covered the leap as well as
the Squirrel did, and away they went as
before.</p>



<p>Every wise Squirrel knows all the leaps
in his woods, those which he can easily
make, and those which will call for every
ounce of power in his legs. The devilish
pertinacity of the Weasel, still hard after
him, compelled him to adopt a scheme.
He made for a wide leap, the very limit
of his powers, where the take-off was the
end of a big broken branch, and racing
six hops behind was the Brown Terror.
Without a moment's pause went Bannertail
easily across the six-foot gap, to land
on a sturdy limb in the other tree. And the
Weasel! He knew he could not make it,
hung back an instant, gathered his legs
under him, snarled, glared redder-eyed
than ever, bobbed down a couple of times,
measured the distance with his eye, then
wheeled and, racing back, went down
the tree, to cross and climb the one
that sheltered the Squirrel. Bannertail
quietly hopped to a higher perch, and,
when the right time came, leaped back
again to the stout oak bough. Again the
Weasel, with dogged pertinacity, raced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a><br /><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
down and up, only to see the Graysquirrel
again leap lightly across the impassable
gulf. Most hunters would have
given up now, but there is no end to the
dogged stick-to-itiveness of the Weasel;
besides, he was hungry. And half-a-dozen
times he had made the long circuit
while his intended victim took the short
leap. Then Bannertail, gaining confidence,
hit on a plan which, while it may
have been meant for mere teasing, had
all the effect of a deep stratagem played
with absolute success.</p>

<span class="caption">BAFFLING FIRE-EYES</span>
</div>
<p>When next the little red-eyed terror
came racing along the oak limb, Bannertail
waited till the very last moment, then
leaped, grasped the far-side perch, and,
turning, "yipped" out one derisive
"<i>grrrf, grrrf, grrrf</i>" after another, and
craned forward in mockery of the little
fury. This was too much. Wild with
rage, the Weasel took the leap, fell far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
short, and went whirling head over heels
down seventy-five feet, to land not in the
soft snow but on a hard-oak log, that
knocked out his cruel wind, and ended
for the day all further wish to murder or
destroy.</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>THE Snow-moon was waning,
the Hunger-moon at hand,
when Bannertail met with
another adventure. He had
gone far off to the pine
woods of a deep glen, searching for cones,
when he was set on by a Redsquirrel.
Flouncing over the plumy boughs it came,
chattering: "<i>Squat, squat, quit, quit, quit</i>"&mdash;"<i>git,
git, git</i>"&mdash;and each moment
seemed more inclined to make a tooth-and-nail
attack on Bannertail. And he,
what had he to fear? Was he not bigger
and stronger than the Red-headed One?
Yes, very well able to overmatch him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
fight, but his position was much like that
of a grown man who is assailed by a blackguard
boy. There is no glory in the fight,
if it comes to that. There is much unpleasant
publicity, and the man usually
decides that it is better to ignore the insult
and retreat. This was Bannertail's
position exactly. He hated a row&mdash;most
wild things do&mdash;it brings them into
notice of the very creatures they wish to
avoid. Besides, the Redsquirrel was not
without some justification, for these were
his pine-trees by right of long possession.
Bannertail, without touch of violence
or fear of it, yielded to the inward impulses,
yielded and retreated, closely pursued
by the Redsquirrel, who kept just
out of reach, but worked himself up into
a still noisier rage as he saw the invader
draw off. It was characteristic of the
Red One that he did not stop at the border
of his own range but followed right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
into the hickory country, shrieking: "<em>Git,
git, ye brute ye, ye brute ye, git!</em>" with insolence
born of his success, though its
real explanation was beyond him.</div>

</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THE Hunger-moon, our February,
was half worn away
when again the sky gods
seemed to win against the
powers of chill and gloom.
Food was ever scarcer, but Bannertail
had enough, and was filled with the vigor
of young life. The sun came up in a cloudless
sky that day, and blazed through the
branches of still, tense woodland, the air
was crisp and exhilarating, and Bannertail,
tingling with the elation of life,
leaped up for the lust of leaping, and
sang out his loudest song:</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Qua, qua, qua, quaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!</i>"
from a high perch. Ringing across the
woodland it went, and the Woodwales
drummed on hardwood drums, in keen
responsiveness, to the same fair, vernal
influence of the time.</p>

<p>Though he seemed only to sing for
singing's sake, he was conscious lately of
a growing loneliness, a hankering for company
that had never possessed him all
winter; indeed, he had resented it when
any hint of visitors had reached him, but
now he was restless and desireful, as well
as bursting with the wish to sing.</p>

<p>"<i>Qua, qua, qua, quaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!</i>"
he sang again and again, and on the still,
bright air were echoes from the hills.</p>

<p>"<i>Qua, qua, quaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!</i>" He
poured it out again, and the echo came,
"<i>Qua, quaaaaa!</i>" Then another call, and
the echo, "<i>Quaaa!</i>"</p>

<p>Was it an echo?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>He waited in silence&mdash;then far away
he heard the soft "<i>Qua, quaa</i>" that had
caught his ear last fall. The voice of
another Graycoat, but so soft and alluring
that it thrilled him. Here, indeed,
was the answer to the hankering in his
heart.</p>

<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_075.jpg" width="185" height="187" alt="two squirrels linked by thier hearts" />
</div>

<p>But even as he craned and strained to
locate its very place, another call was
heard:</p>

<div class='center'>
"<i>Qua, qua, qua, quaaaaaa</i>"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>from some big strong Graycoat like himself,
and all the fighting blood in him was
stirred. He raced to the ground and
across the woodland to the hillside whence
the voice came.</div>

<p>On a log he stopped, with senses
alert for new guidance. "<i>Qua, qua,
quaaa</i>," came the soft call, and up the
tree went Bannertail, a silvery tail-tip
flashed behind the trunk, and now, ablaze
with watchfulness, he followed fast. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
came a lone, long "<i>Qua, qua</i>," then a
defiant "<i>Grrff</i>," like a scream, and a
third big Graysquirrel appeared, to scramble
up after Bannertail.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="111" height="113" alt=""/>
</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>AWAY went Silvergray, undulating
among the high
branches that led to the
next tree, and keen behind
came the two. Then they
met at the branch that had furnished the
footway for the Gray Lady, and in a moment
they clinched. Grappling like cats,
they drove their teeth into each other's
shoulders, just where the hide was thickest
and the danger least.</div>

<p>In their combat rage they paid no heed
to where they were. Their every clutch
was on each other, none for the branch,
and over they tumbled into open space.</p>

<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_080.jpg" width="361" height="163" alt="two squirrels jousting" />
</div>

<p>Two fighting cats so falling would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
clutched the harder and hoped each that
the other would be the one to land on
the under side. Squirrels have a different
way. Sensing the fall, at once
they sprang apart, each fluffed his great
flowing tail to the utmost&mdash;it is nature's
own "land-easy"&mdash;they landed gently,
wide apart, and quite unshaken even by
the fall. Overhead was the Lady of
the tourney, in plain view, and the two
stout knights lost not a moment in darting
up her tree; again they met on a
narrow limb, again they clutched and
stabbed each other with their chisel teeth,
again the reckless grapple, clutch, and
the drop in vacant air&mdash;again they shot
apart, one landed on the solid ground,
but the other&mdash;the echo voice&mdash;went
splash, plunge into the deepest part
of the creek! In ten heart-beats he
was safely on the bank. But there is
such soothing magic in cold water, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
quenching of all fires, be they of smoke
or love or war, that the Echo Singer
crawled forth in quite a different mood,
and Bannertail, flashing up the great
tree trunk, went now alone.</p>

<p>To have conquered a rival is a long
step toward victory, but it is not yet
victory complete. When he swung from
limb to limb, ever nearer the Silvergray,
he was stirred with the wildest hankering
of love. Was she not altogether lovely?
But she fled away as though she feared
him; and away he went pursuing.</p>

<p>There is no more exquisite climbing
action than that of the Squirrel, and
these two, half a leap apart, winding,
wending, rippling through the high roof-tree
of the woods, were less like two gray
climbing things than some long, silvery
serpent, sinuating, flashing in and out in
undulating coils with endless grace and
certainty among the trees.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_082.jpg" width="256" height="113" alt="man at foot of woman" />
</div>

<p>Now who will say that Silvergray
really raced her fastest, and who will
deny that he did his best? He was
strong and swift, the race must end, and
then she faced him with anger and menace
simulated in her face and pose. He
approached too near; her chisel teeth
closed on his neck. He held still, limp,
absolutely unresisting. Her clutch relaxed.
Had he not surrendered? They
stood facing each other, an armed neutrality
established, nothing more.</p>

<p>Shyly apart and yet together, they
drifted about that day, feeding at feed
time. But she was ready to warn him
that his distance he must keep.</p>

<p>By countless little signs they understood
each other, and when the night
came she entered a familiar hollow tree
and warned him to go home.</p>

<span class="caption">THEY TWIDDLED WHISKERS GOOD NIGHT</span>
</div>

<p>Next day they met again, and the
next, for there is a rule of woodland
courtship&mdash;three times he must offer and
be refused. Having passed this proof,
all may be well.</p>

<p>Thus the tradition of the woods was
fully carried out, and Bannertail with
Silvergray was looking for a home.</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>BANNERTAIL was very well
satisfied with the home in
the red oak, and assumed
that thither he should bring
his bride. But he had not
reckoned with certain big facts&mdash;that is,
laws&mdash;for the reason that he had never
before met them. The female wild thing
claims all authority in matters of the
home, and in the honeymoon time no
wild mate would even challenge her right
to rule.</div>

<p>So the red oak den was then and there
abandoned. Search in the hickory grove
resulted in a find. A Flicker had dug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
into the trunk of a tall hickory where it
was dead. Once through the outer shell
the inner wood was rotten punk, too easy
for a Flicker to work in, but exactly right
and easy for a Graysquirrel. Here, then,
the two set to work digging out the soft
rotten wood till the chamber was to
their liking, much bigger than that the
Woodpecker would have made.</p>

<p>March, the Wakening-moon, was spent
in making the home and lining the nest.
Bark strips, pine-needles, fine shreds of
plants that had defied the wind and
snow, rags of clothes left by winter woodmen,
feathers, tufts of wool, and many
twigs of basswood with their swollen
buds, and slippery-elm, and one or two&mdash;yes,
Silvergray could not resist the
impulse&mdash;fat acorns found from last
year's crop and hidden now deep in the
lining of the nest. There can be no happier
time for any wild and lusty live thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
than when working with a loving mate
at the building and making of the nest.
Their world is one of joy&mdash;fine weather,
fair hunting, with food enough, overwhelming
instincts at their flush of compulsion&mdash;all
gratified in sanest, fullest
measure. This sure is joy, and Bannertail
met each yellow sun-up with his
loudest song of praise, as he watched
it from the highest lookout of his home
tree. His "<i>qua</i>" song reached afar, and
in its vibrant note expressed the happy
time, and expressing it, intensified it in
himself. There seemed no ill to mar the
time. Even the passing snow-storms of
the month seemed trifles; they were little
more than landmarks on the joyful way.</p>

</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THE stormy moon of March
was nearly over when a
change came on their happy
comradeship. Silvergray
seemed to beget a coolness,
a singular aloofness. If they were on the
same branch together she did not sit
touching him. If he moved to where she
chanced to stand, and tried, as a thousand
times before, to snuggle up, she moved
away. The cloud, whatever it was, grew
bigger. In vain he sought by pleasing
acts to win her back. She had definitely
turned against him, and the climax came
when one evening they climbed to their
finished, set, and furnished house. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
whisked in ahead of him, then, turning
suddenly, filled the doorway with her
countenance expressing defiance and hostility,
her sharp teeth menacingly displayed.
She said as plainly as she could:
"You keep away; you are not wanted
here."</div>

<p>And Bannertail, what could he do?
Hurt, rebuffed, not wanted in the house
he had made and loved, turned away
perforce and glumly sought his bachelor
home in the friendly old red oak.</p>

<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_094.jpg" width="190" height="261" alt="face peering out of hole in tree" />
</div>

<p>Whatever was the cause, Bannertail
knew that it was his part to keep away,
at least to respond to her wishes. Next
morning, after feeding, he swung to the
nesting tree. Yes, there she was on a
limb&mdash;but at once she retreated to the
door and repeated the signal, "You are
not wanted here." The next day it was
the same. Then on the third day she
was nowhere to be seen. Bannertail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
hung about hoping for a glimpse, but
none he got. Cautiously, fearfully, he
climbed the old familiar bark-way; silently
arriving at the door, he gently
thrust in his head. The sweet familiar
furry smell told him "yes, she was there."</p>

<p>He moved inward another step. Yes,
there she lay curled up and breathing.
One step more; up she started with an
angry little snort. Bannertail sprang
back and away, but not before he had
seen and sensed this solving of the
mystery. There, snuggling together under
her warm body were three tiny
little baby Squirrels.</p>

<div class="image-right">

<p>For this, indeed, it was that Mother
Nature whispered messages and rules of
conduct. For this time it was she had
dowered this untutored little mother
Squirrel with all the garnered wisdom of
the folk before. Nor did she leave them
now, but sent the very message to Mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Squirrel and Father Squirrel, and the
little ones, too, at the very time when
their own poor knowledge must have
failed.</p>

<p>It was the unspoken hint from her
that made the little mother-soon-to-be
hide in the nesting-place some nuts with
buds of slippery-elm, twigs of spice bush,
and the bitter but nourishing red acorns.
In them was food and tonic for the
trying time. Water she could get near
by, but even that called for no journey
forth, it chanced that a driving rain
drenched the tree, and at the very door
she found enough to drink.</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>BANNERTAIL was left to
himself, like a bachelor
driven to his club. He had
become very wise in woodlore
so that the food question
was no longer serious. Not counting
the remnant of the nuts still unearthed,
the swelling buds of every sweet-sapped
tree were wholesome, delicious
food, the inner bark of sweet birch twigs
was good, there were grubs and borers
under flakes of bark, the pucker berries
or red chokeberries that grow in the lowlands
still hung in clusters. Their puckery
sourness last fall had made all creatures
let them alone, but a winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
weathering had sweetened them, and
now they were toothsome as well as
abundant sustenance.</div>



<p>Another, wholly different food, was
added to the list. With the bright spring
days the yellow Sapsucker arrived from
the South. He is a crafty bird and a
lover of sweets. His plan is to drill with
his sharp beak a hole deep through the
bark of a sugar-maple, so the sap runs
out and down the bark, lodging in the
crevices; and not one but a score of trees
he taps. Of course the sun evaporates
the sap, so it becomes syrup, and even
sugar on the edges. This attracts many
spring insects, which get entangled in the
sticky stuff, and the Sapsucker, going
from tree to tree in the morning, feasts
on a rich confection of candied bugs.
But many other creatures of the woods
delight in this primitive sweetmeat, and
Bannertail did not hesitate to take it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
when he could find it. Although animals
have some respect for property law
among their own kind, might is the only
right they own in dealing with others.</p>
<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_100.jpg" width="206" height="183" alt="Bannertail holding Wood Hunter sign" />
</div>
<p>Amusement aplenty Bannertail found
in building "drays," or tree nests. These
are stick platforms of the simplest open-work,
placed high in convenient trees.
Some are for lookouts, some for sleeping-porches
when the night is hot, some are
for the sun-bath that every wise Squirrel
takes. Here he would lie on his back in
the morning sun with his belly exposed,
his limbs outsprawling, and let the healing
sun-rays strike through the thin skin,
reaching every part with their actinic
power.</p>

<p>Bannertail did it because it was pleasant,
and he ceased doing it when it no
longer pleased him. Is not this indeed
Dame Nature's way? Pain is her protest
against injury, and soothingness in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the healthy creature is the proof that it
is doing good. Many disorders we know
are met or warded off by this sun-bath.
We know it now. Not long ago we had
no fuller information than had Bannertail
on such things. We knew only that
it felt good at the time and left us feeling
better; so we took it, as he took it,
when the need of the body called for it,
and ceased as he did, when the body no
longer desired it.</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>THE bond between them had
kept Bannertail near his
mate, and her warning kept
him not too near. Yet it
was his daily wont to come
to the nesting tree and wait about, in
case of anything, he knew not what.
Thus it was that he heard a rustling
in the near-by limbs one day, then
caught a flash of red. A stranger approaching
the tree of trees. All Bannertail's
fighting blood was aroused. He
leaped by well-known jumps, and coursed
along well-known overways, till he was
on the nesting tree, and undulated like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
silvery shadow up the familiar trunk to
find himself facing the very Redsquirrel
whose range he once had entered and
from whom he, Bannertail, had fled.
But what a change of situation and of
heart! Redhead scoffed and shook his
flaming tail. He shrieked his "<i>skit, skit</i>"
and stood prepared to fight. Did Bannertail
hold back&mdash;he, Bannertail, that
formerly had declined the combat with
this very rogue? Not for an instant.
There was new-engendered power within
compelling him. He sprang on the Red
bandit with all his vigor and drove his
teeth in deep. The Redhead was a
fighter, too. He clinched and bit. They
clung, wrestled and stabbed, then, losing
hold of the tree, went hurling to the
earth below. In air they flung apart,
but landing unhurt they clinched again
on the ground; then the Redhead, bleeding
from many little wounds, and over-matched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
sought to escape, dodged this
way and that, found refuge in a hole
under a root; and Bannertail, breathless,
with two or three slight stabs, swung
slowly up the tree from which Silvergray
had watched the fight of her mate.</div>

<p>There never yet was feminine heart
that withheld its meed of worship from
her fighting champion coming home victorious&mdash;which
reason may not have entered
into it at all. But this surely
counted: The young ones' eyes were
opened, they were no longer shapeless
lumps of flesh. They were fuzzy little
Squirrels. The time had come for the
father to rejoin the brood.</p>

<p>With the come-together instinct that
follows fight, he climbed to the very
doorway; she met him there, whisker to
whisker. She reached out and licked
his wounded shoulder; when she reentered
the den he came in too; nosing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
his brood to get their smell, just as a
woman mother buries her nose in the
creasy neck of her baby; he gently
curled about them all, and the reunited
family went sound asleep in their single
double bed.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE HOODOO ON THE HOME</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_n.jpg" width="115" height="117" alt=""/>
</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOT many days later they had
a new unfriendly visitor. It
was in the morning rest hour
that follows early breakfast.
The familiar <i>cluck, cluck</i> of a
Flicker had sounded from a near tree-top.
Then his stirring <i>tattoo</i> was heard on a
high dead limb of the one tree. A little
later a scratching sound, and the hole
above was darkened by the head and
shoulders of a big bird peering down at
them through the opening. His long,
sharp beak was opened to utter a loud
startling "<i>clape!</i>" Up leaped Bannertail
to meet and fight off the invader.
There was little fighting to be done, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the Flicker sprang back, and on to a
high limb. His fighting feathers were
raised, and his threatening beak did
look very dangerous, but he did not
wait for Bannertail to spring on him.
He swooped away in a glory of yellow
wings, and with a chuckle of derision.
It was a small incident, but it made a
second break in their sense of secrecy.</div>

<p>Then came another little shock. The
Bluejay, the noisy mischief-maker, was
prowling around the farmhouse, and high
on a ledge he found a handful of big horse-chestnuts
gathered by the boy "to throw
at cats." Had he been hungry the Jay
would have eaten them, but choice food
was plentiful, so now his storage instincts
took charge. The Bluejay nearly
sprained his bill getting a hold on a nut,
then carried it off, looking for a hollow
tree in which to hide it, as is the custom
of his kind. The hole he found was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Squirrel's nest. He meant to take a good
look in before dropping it, but the nut
was big and heavy, smooth and round.
It slipped from his beak plump into the
sleeping family, landing right on Bannertail's
nose. Up he jumped with a snort
and rushed to the door. The Bluejay
was off at a safe distance, and chortled a
loud "<i>Tooral, tooral, jay, jay!</i>" in mischievous
mockery, then flew away. Bannertail
might have taken that nut for a
friendly gift, but its coming showed that
the den was over-visible. There was
something wrong with it.</p>

<p>Later the very same day, the Bluejay
did this same thing with another big
chestnut. Evidently now he enjoyed the
commotion that followed the dropping of
the nut.</p>

<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_113.jpg" width="191" height="409" alt="tree" />
</div>

<p>One day later came a still more disturbing
event. A roving, prowling cur found
the fresh Squirrel track up the tree, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
"yapped" so persistently that two boys
who were leagued with the dog for all
manner of evil, came, marked the hole
and spent half an hour throwing stones
at it, varying their volleys with heavy
pounding on the trunk to "make the
Squirrel come out."</p>
<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_115.jpg" width="97" height="274" alt="bugs" />
</div>
<p>Of course, neither Bannertail nor Silvergray
did show themselves. That is
very old wood-wisdom. "Lay low, keep
out of sight when the foe is on the war-path."
And at last the besiegers and
their yap-colleague tramped away without
having seen sign or hair of a Squirrel.</p>

<p>There was very little to the incident,
but it sank deep into Silvergray's
small brain. "This nest is ill-concealed.
Every hostile creature finds it."</p>

<p>There was yet another circumstance
that urged action. Shall I tell it? It is
so unpicturesque. A Squirrel's nest is a
breeding-ground for vermin; a nest that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
is lined with soft grass, feathers, and
wool becomes a swarming hive. Bannertail's
farm upbringing had made him all
too familiar with feathers and wool. His
contribution to the home furnishing had
been of the kind that guaranteed a parasitic
scourge. This thing he had not
learned&mdash;for it is instilled by the smell
of their mother nest&mdash;cedar bark and
sassafras leaves, with their pungent oils,
are needed to keep the irritating vermin
swarm away. And Silvergray, was she
at fault? Only in this, the purifying bark
and leaves were scarce. She was weak
compared with Bannertail. His contributions
had so far outpointed hers that
the nest had become unbearable. Their
only course was to abandon it.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="109" height="110" alt=""/>
</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>TWICE a day now Silvergray
left the little ones, to forage
for herself, soon after sunrise
and just before sunset.
It was on the morning outing
that she went house hunting. And
Bannertail went too. Ever he led to the
cosey home in his old red oak. But there is
a right that is deeply rooted in custom, in
logic, and in female instinct, that it is the
she-one's privilege to select, prepare, and
own the home. Every suggestion that he
made by offered lead or actual entry, was
scorned and the one who made it, snubbed.
She did her own selecting, and, strangest
thing of all, she chose the rude stick nest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of a big-winged Hawk, abandoned now,
for the Hawk himself, with his long-clawed
mate, was nailed to the end of
the barn.</div>

<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_120.jpg" width="206" height="334" alt="nest" />
</div>

<p>Winter storm and beaming sun had
purged and purified the rough old aerie;
it was high on a most unclimbable tree,
yet sheltered in the wood, and here Silvergray
halted in her search. All about
the nest and tree she climbed, and smelled
to find the little owner marks, of musk or
rasping teeth, if such there should be&mdash;the
marks that would have warned her
that this place was already possessed.
But none there were. The place was
without taint, bore only through and
through the clean, sweet odor of the woods
and wood.</p>

<p>And this is how she took possession:
She rubbed her body on the rim of the
nest, she nibbled off projecting twiglets,
she climbed round and round the trunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
below and above, thus leaving her foot
and body scent everywhere about, then
gathered a great mouthful of springtime
twigs, with their soft green leaves, and
laid them in the Hawk nest for the floor-cloth
of her own.</p>

<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_121.jpg" width="131" height="107" alt="oak branch" />
</div>

<p>She went farther, and found a sassafras,
with its glorious flaming smell of
incense, its redolence of aromatic purity,
and with a little surge of joy instinctive
she gathered bundle after bundle of the
sweet, strong twigs, spread them out for
the rug and matting of the house. And
Bannertail did the same, and for a while
they worked in harmony. Then was
struck a harsh, discordant note.</p>

<p>Crossing the forest floor Bannertail
found a rag, a mitten that some winter
woodcutter had cast away, and, still obsessed
with the nursery garnish of his own
farm-kitten days, he pounced on this and
bore it gleefully to the nest that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
abuilding. And Silvergray, what said
she, as the evil thing was brought? She
had no clear ideas, no logic from the other
ill-starred home. She could not say:
"There was hoodoo on it, and this ragged
woollen mitt seems hoodoo-like to me."
But these were her strange reactions.
"The smell of that other nest was like
this; that smell is linked with every evil
memory. I do not want it here." Her
instinct, the inherited wisdom of her forebears,
indorsed this view, and as she
sniffed and sniffed, the smell inspired her
with intense hostility, a hostility that in
the other nest was somewhat offset by the
smell of her loved brood, but this was not&mdash;it
was wholly strange and hostile.
Her neck hair rose, her tail trembled a
little, as, acting under the new and growing
impulse of violent dislike, she hurled
the offending rag far from the threshold
of her nest. Flop it went to the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
below. And Bannertail, not quite understanding,
believed this to be an accident.
Down he went as fast as his fast feet
could carry him, seized on the ragged
mitten, brought it again to the home-building.
But the instinct that had been
slow arousing was now dominant in Silvergray.
With an angry chatter she
hurled the accursed thing afar, and made
it clear by snort and act that "such things
come not there."</p>

<p>This was the strenuous founding of the
new nest, and these were among the
hidden springs of action and of unshaped
thoughts that ruled the founding.</p>

<p>The nest was finished in three days. A
rain roof over all of fresh flat leaves, an
inner lining of chewed cedar bark, an
abundance of aromatic sassafras, one or
two little quarrels over accidental rags
that Bannertail still seemed to think
worth while. But the new nest was finished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
pure and sweet with a consecrating,
plague-defying aroma of cedar and of sassafras
to be its guardian angel.</p>

</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>IT was very early in the morning,
soon after sunrise, that
they took the hazard of
moving the young. Silvergray
had fed the babies and
looked out and about, and had come back
and looked again. Then, picking up the
nearest by the scruff of its neck, she rose
to the doorway. Now a great racket
sounded in the woods. Silvergray backed
in again and down, dropped the young
one, then put her head out. The noise
increased, the trampling of heavy feet.
She backed till only her nose was out, and
watched. Soon there came in view huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
red-and-white creatures with horns. She
had often seen them, and held them
harmless, but why were they moving so
fast? There were other noises coming,
much smaller, indeed, but oh, how much
more dangerous were the two that followed
and drove the herd!&mdash;a tow-topped
boy and a yellow-coated dog. At war
with all the world of harmless wood-folk,
these two would leave a trail of slaughtered
bodies in their wake, if only their
weapons were as deadly as their wishes.
So Silvergray sank back and brooded over
the nursery, varying her loving mothering
with violent scratching of a hind foot,
or sudden pounce to capture with her
teeth some shiny, tiny creeping thing
among the bed stuff or on the young ones'
fluffy skins.</div>

<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_129.jpg" width="208" height="80" alt="soaring hawk" />
</div>
<p>The sun was up above the trees. The
Bluejay sang "<i>Too-root-el-too-root-el</i>,"
which means, "all clear." And the glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Red Singing-Hawk was wheeling in great
rhythmic swoops to the sound of his
own wild note, "<i>Kyo-kyo-kyoooo.</i>" He
wheeled and rejoiced in his song and his
flight.</p>

<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_130.jpg" width="185" height="221" alt="moving babies" />
</div>

<p>"All's clear! All's well!" sang Crow
and Bluejay&mdash;these watchful ones,
watchful, perforce, because their ways
of rapine have filled the world with enemies.
And Silvergray prepared a second
time for the perilous trip. She took
the nearest of her babies, gently but
firmly, and, scrambling to the door,
paused to look and listen, then took the
final plunge, went scurrying and scrambling
down the trunk. On the ground
she paused again, looked forward and
back, then to the old nest to see her mate
go in and come out again with a young
one in his mouth, as though he knew exactly
what was doing and how his help
was needed. With an angry "<i>Quare!</i>"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
she turned and scrambled up again,
bumping the baby she bore with many a
needless jolt, and met Bannertail. Nothing
less than rage was in her voice,
"<i>Quare, quare, quare!</i>" and she sprang at
him. He could not fail to understand.
He dropped the baby on a broad, safe
crotch, and whisked away to turn and
gaze with immeasurable surprise. "Isn't
that what you wanted, you hothead?" he
seemed to say. "Didn't we plan to move
the kids?" Her only answer was a hissing
"<i>Quare!</i>" She rushed to the stranded
little one, made one or two vain efforts to
carry it, as well as the one already in her
mouth, then bounded back to the old
home with her own charge, dropped it,
came rushing back for the second, took
that home, too, then vented all her wrath
and warnings in a loud, long "<i>Qua!</i>"
which plainly meant: "You let the
kids alone. I don't need your help. I
wouldn't trust you. This is a mother's
job."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;">

<span class="caption">WITH AN ANGRY &quot;QUARE!&quot; SILVERGRAY SCRAMBLED UP AGAIN</span>
</div>

<p>She stayed and brooded over them a
long time before making the third attempt.
And this time the impulse came
from the tickling crawlers in the bed.
She looked forth, saw Bannertail sitting
up high, utterly bewildered. She gave a
great warning "<i>Qua!</i>" seized number one
for the third time, and forth she leaped
to make the great migration.</p>

<p>The wood was silent except for its
own contented life, and she got half-way
to the new nest, when high on a broad,
safe perch she paused and set her burden
down. Was it the maddening tickling of
a crawler that gave the hint, or was it
actual wisdom in the lobes behind those
liquid eyes? Who knows? Only this is
sure, she looked that baby over from end
to end. She hunted out and seized in her
teeth and ground to shreds ten of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a><br /><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
plaguing crawlers. She combed herself,
she scratched and searched her coat from
head to tail, and on her neck, where she
could not see, she combed and combed,
till of this she was certain, no insects of
the tickling, teasing kind were going with
her to the new home. Then seizing her
baby by the neck-scruff, up she bounded,
and in ten heart-beats he was lying in
their new and fragrant bed.</p>

<p>For a little while she cuddled him there,
to "bait him to it," as the woodsmen say.
Then, with a parting licking of his head,
she quit the nest and hied away for the
rest of the brood.</p>
<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_133.jpg" width="180" height="317" alt="Bannertail cleaning up" />
</div>
<p>Bannertail had taken the hint. He
was still up high, watching, but not going
near the old nest.</p>

<p>Silvergray took number two and did
the very same with him, deloused him
thoroughly on the same old perch, then
left him with the first. The third went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
through the same. And Silvergray was
curled up with the three in the new high
nest for long, before Bannertail, after
much patient, watchful waiting, seeing no
return of Silvergray, went swinging to the
old nest to peep in, and realized that it
was empty, cold, abandoned.</p>



<p>He sat and thought it over. On a high,
sunny perch that he had often used, he
made his toilet, as does every healthy
Squirrel, thoroughly combed his coat and
captured all, that is, one or two of the
crawlers that had come from the old nest.
He drank of the spring, went foraging for
a while, then swung to the new-made
nest and shyly, cautiously, dreading a rebuff,
went slowly in. Yes, there they
were. But would she take him in? He
uttered the low, soft, coaxing "<i>Er-er-er-er</i>,"
which expresses every gentleness in
the range of Squirrel thought and feeling.
No answer. He made no move, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
again gave a coaxing "<i>Er-er-er</i>," a long
pause, then from the hovering furry form
in the nest came one soft "<i>Er</i>," and
Bannertail, without reserve, glided in
and curled about them all.</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>APRIL, the Green-grass
Moon, was nearly gone, the
Graycoats in their new high
home were flourishing and
growing. Happy and ed
now, it was an event like a young
girl's coming-out, when first these Squirrelets
came forth from the nest "on their
own," and crawling on their trembling
legs, with watchful mother nigh. They one
by one scrambled on to the roof of the
home, and, with a general air of "Aren't
we big; aren't we wonderful?" they
stretched and basked in the bright warm
morning sun.</div>

<p>A Hawk came wheeling high over the
tree tops. He was not hunting, for he
wheeled and whistled as he wheeled. Silvergray
knew him well, and marked his
ample wings. She had seen a Redtail
raid. This might not be of the bandit
kind, but a Hawk is a Hawk. She gave
a low, warning "<i>Chik, chik</i>" to the family,
to which they paid not a whit of attention.
So she seized each in turn by
the handy neck-scruff, and bundled him
indoors to safety.</p>



<p>Three times this took place on different
days. Three times the mother's vigorous
lug home was needed, and by now the lesson
was learned. "<i>Chik, chik</i>" meant
"Look out; danger; get home."</p>

<p>They were growing fast now. Their
coats were sleek and gray. Their tails
were as yet poor skimps of things, but
their paws were strong and their claws
were sharp as need be. They could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
scramble all about the old Hawk nest and
up and down the rugged bark of the near
trunk. Their different dispositions began
to show as well as their different gifts and
make-up.</p>

</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>SQUIRRELS do not name
their babies as we do; they
do not think of them by
names; and yet each one is
itself, has individual looks
or ways that stand for that one in the
mother's mind, so is in some sort its name.
Thus the biggest one had a very brown
head and a very gray coat. He was
stronger than the others, could leap just
a little farther and was not so ready to
bite when playing with the rest. The
second brother was not so big as Brownhead,
and he had an impatient way of
rebelling at any little thing that did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
please him. He would explode into a
shrill "<i>Cray!</i>" which was a well-known
Squirrel exclamation, only he made it
very thin and angry. Even to father and
mother he would shriek "<i>Cray!</i>" if they
did in the least a thing that was not to
his wish.</div>

<p>The third and smallest was a little girl-Squirrel,
very shy and gentle. She loved
to be petted and would commonly snuggle
up to mother, whining softly, "<i>Nyek,
nyek</i>," even when her brothers were playing,
as well as at feeding-time. So in this
sort they named themselves, Brownhead,
Cray, and Nyek-nyek.</p>

<p>The first lesson in all young wild life is
this, "Do as you are told"; the penalty of
disobedience is death, not always immediate,
not clearly consequent, but soon or
late it comes. This indeed is the law,
driven home and clinched by ages of experience:
"Obey or die."</p>

<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_144.jpg" width="308" height="239" alt="scales" />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>If the family is outstretched in the sun,
and keen-eyed mother sees a Hawk, she
says, "<i>Chik, chik</i>," and the wise little ones
come home. They obey and live. The
rebellious one stays out, and the Hawk
picks him up, a pleasant meal.</p>

<p>If the family is scrambling about the
tree trunk and one attempts to climb a
long, smooth stretch, from which the
bark has fallen, mother cries "<i>Chik, chik</i>,"
warning that he is going into danger.
The obedient one comes back and lives.
The unruly one goes on. There is no
clawhold on such trunks. He falls far
to the ground and pays the price.</p>
<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_146.jpg" width="253" height="323" alt="squirrel holding pitcher over its head" />
</div>
<p>If one is being carried from a place of
danger, and hangs limp and submissive
from his mother's mouth, he is quickly
landed in a place of safety. But one
that struggles and rebels, may be cut by
mother's tightening teeth, or dropped by
her and seized on by some enemy at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
hand. There are always enemies alert
for such a chance. Or if he swings to
drink at the familiar spring and sees not
what mother sees, a Blacksnake lurking
on a log, or heeds not her sharp "Keep
back," he goes, and maybe takes a single
sip, but it is his last.</p>

<p>If one, misled by their bright color,
persists in eating fruit of the deadly
nightshade, ignoring mother's warning,
"<i>Quare, quare!</i>" he eats, he has willed to
eat; and there is a little Squirrel body
tumbled from the nest next day, to claim
the kindly care of growing plants and
drifting leaves that will hide it from the
view.</p>



<p>Yes, this is the law, older than the day
when the sun gave birth to our earth that
it might go its own way yet still be held
in law: "Obey and live; rebel and die."</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>BOISTEROUS, strong, and
merry was Brownhead, the
very son of his father.
Eager to do and ready to
go; yet quick to hear
when the warning came, "<i>Quare</i>," or the
home call, "<i>Chik, chik</i>." Well-fleshed
was he and deeply fur-clad, although it was
scarcely mid-May, and his tail already was
past the switch stage and was frilling out
with the silver frill of his best kin. Frolicsome,
merry, and shy, very shy was Nyek-nyek.
In some speech she would have
been styled a "mammy pet." Happy
with mother, playing with her brothers,
but ever ready to go to mother. Slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of body, but quick to move, quick to follow,
and nervously quick to obey, she grew
and learned the learning of her folk.</div>

<p>Last was Cray, quickest of them all,
not so heavy as Brownhead, yet agile, inquisitive,
full of energy, but a rebel all
the time. He would climb that long,
smooth column above the nest. His
mother's warning held him not. And
when the clawhold failed he slipped, but
jumped and landed safe on a near limb.</p>

<p>He would go forth to investigate the
loud trampling in the woods, and far below
him watched with eager curiosity the
big, two-legged thing that soon discovered
him. Then there was a loud crack like a
heavy limb broken by the wind, and the
bark beside his head was splintered by a
blow that almost stunned him with its
shock, although it did not touch him.
He barely escaped into the nest. Yes, he
still escaped.</p>

TO SCHOOL</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="109" height="110" alt=""/>
</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THESE are among the lessons
that a mother Squirrel, by
example, teaches, and that
in case of failure are emphasized
by many little reproofs
of voice, or even blows:</div>

<p>Clean your coat, and extra-clean your
tail; fluff it out, try its trig suppleness,
wave it, plume it, comb it, clean it; but
ever remember it, for it is your beauty
and your life.</p>

<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_153.jpg" width="148" height="225" alt="Rules" />
</div>

<p>When there is danger on the ground,
such as the trampling of heavy feet, do
not go to spy it out, but hide. If near
a hole, pop in; if on a big high limb, lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
flat and still as death. Do not go to it.
Let it come to you, if it will.</p>

<p>In the air, if there is danger near, as
from Hawks, do not stop until you have
at least got into a dense thicket, or, better
still, a hole.</p>

<p>If you find a nut when you are not
hungry, bury it for future use. Nevertheless
this lesson counted for but little
now, as all last year's nuts were gone,
and this year's far ahead.</p>

<p>If you must travel on the ground, stop
every little while at some high place to
look around, and fail not then each time
to fluff and jerk your tail.</p>

<p>When in the distant limbs you see
something that may be friend or foe,
keep out of sight, but flirt your white
tail tip in his view. If it be a Graycoat,
it will answer with the same, the wigwag:
"I'm a Squirrel, too."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;">
<img src="images/i_153fp.jpg" width="419" height="581" alt="three little squirrels listening to parent" />
<span class="caption">THE LITTLE SQUIRRELS AT SCHOOL</span>
</div>

<p>Learn and practise, also, the far jumps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
from tree to tree. You'll surely need
them some day. They are the only certain
answer to the Red-eyed Fury that
lives on Mice, but that can kill Squirrels,
too, if he catches them; that climbs and
jumps, but cannot jump so far as the
Graycoats, and dare not fall from high,
for he has no plumy tail, nothing but a
useless little tag.</p>

<p>Drink twice a day from the running
stream, never from the big pond in which
the grinning Pike and mighty Snapper
lie in wait. Go not in the heat of the day,
for then the Blacksnake is lurking near,
and quicker is he even than a Squirrel,
on the ground.</p>

<p>Go not at dusk, for then the Fox and
the Mink are astir. Go not by night,
for then is the Owl on the war-path, silent
as a shadow; he is far more to be feared
than the swish-winged Hawk. Drink
then at sunrise and before sunset, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
ever from a solid log or stone which affords
good footing for a needed sudden
jump. And remember ever that safety
is in the tree tops&mdash;in this and in lying
low.</p>

<p>These were the lessons they slowly
learned, not at any stated time or
place, but each when the present doings
gave it point. Brownhead was quick
and learned almost overfast; and his tail
responding to his daily care was worthy
of a grown-up. Lithe, graceful Nyek-nyek
too, was growing wood-wise. Cray
was quick for a time. He would learn
well at a new lesson, then, devising some
method of his own, would go ahead and
break the rules. His mother's warning
"<i>Quare</i>" held him back not at all. And
his father's onslaught with a nip of
powerful teeth only stirred him to rebellious
fight.</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>CURIOSITY may be the trail
to knowledge, but it skirts a
dangerous cliff. The Rose
moon, June, was on the hills,
its thrill joy set the whole
wood world joy-thrilling. The Bannertail
family had frolicked in a game of tag-and-catch
all around the old Hawk nest,
and up the long smooth pole went Cray
to show that he could do it. His mother
warned him, "<i>Quare!</i>" but up he went,
and down he came without a hint of
failure. Then they scattered, scampering
for a game of hide-and-seek, when the
heavy sound of some big brute a-coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
was wind-borne to them. The mother
gave the warning "<i>Chik</i>." Three of them
quickly got to the safe old nest. Silvergray
flattened on the up side of a rugged
limb; Cray, seeing nothing near, and
scoffing at their flurry, made for a big
crotch into which he could sink from
sight if need be, and waited. In vain his
mother cried, "<i>Chik</i>"; Cray wouldn't
"<i>chik</i>"; he wanted to know what it was
all about. The heavy trampling sound
came near. Silvergray peeped over and
could see very well; it was the two-legged
Brute with the yellow yapping four-legs
that she more than once had met before.
They rambled slashingly around; the
Yap-cur eagerly wagging his hideous tail.
He swung his black snout in the air, gave
out a long "<i>Yap!</i>" another and another.
Then the Two-legs came slowly nearer,
staring up into the rooftrees and moving
awkwardly sidewise round and round the
tree. Cray peered out farther to watch
him. In vain the wise little mother
Squirrel whispered "<i>Chik, chik!</i>" No,
he would not "<i>chik</i>." As the Ground-brute
circled the tree, Cray, trying to
keep him in sight, quit all attempt at
hiding. The yellow four-legs yapped excitedly.
Then the big Ground-brute held
very still. Cray was amused at this; he
felt so safe that he called out a derisive
"<i>Qua!</i>" There was a loud sound like
thunder, a flash like lightning, and Cray
fell headlong, splashing the gold-green
leaves with his bright, hot young blood.
His mother saw him go with a clutching
of her mother heart. And Mother Carey
saw him go, and said: "It had to be."
For this is the fulfilling of the law; this is
the upbuilding of the race; this is the lopping
of the wayward branch.</div>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BANNERTAIL FALLS INTO A
SNARE</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_b.jpg" width="112" height="113" alt=""/>
</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>BANNERTAIL was now in
fresh midsummer coat of
sleekest gray. His tail was
a silver plume, and bigger
than himself. His health
was perfect. And just so surely as a sick
one longs to be and to stay at home, so
a lusty Squirrel hankers to go a-roaming.</div>

<p>Swinging from tree to tree, leaping the
familiar jump-ways, he left the family one
early morning, drank deeply at the spring
brook, went on aground "hoppity-hop"
for a dozen hops, then stopped to look
around and frisk his tail. Then on, and
again a look around. So he left the hickory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
woods, and swung a mile away, till at
last he was on the far hillside where first
he met the Redhead.</p>

<p>High in a tasselled pine he climbed and
sat, and his fine nose took in the pleasant
gum smells with the zest that came from
their strangeness as much as from their
sweetness.</p>

<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_166.jpg" width="152" height="167" alt="Bannertail carrying a mushroom" />
</div>

<p>As he sat he heard a rustling, racketty
little noise in the thicket near. Flattening
to the bough and tightening in his
tail he watched. What should appear
but his old enemy, the Redhead, dragging,
struggling with something on the ground,
stopping to sputter out his energetic, angry
"<i>Snick, snick</i>," as the thing he
dragged caught in roots and twigs. Bannertail
lay very low and watched intently.
The Redsquirrel fussed and worked with
his burden, now close at hand. Bannertail
saw that it was a flat, round thing,
like an acorn-cup, only many times larger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and reddish, with a big, thick stem on
the wrong side&mdash;a stem that was white,
like new-peeled wood.</p>

<p>Bannertail had seen such growing in the
woods, once or twice; little ones they were,
but his nose and his inner guide had said:
"Let them alone." And here was this
fiery little Redsquirrel dragging one off as
though he had a prize! Sometimes he
lifted it bodily and made good headway,
sometimes it dragged and caught in the
growing twigs. At last it got fixed between
two, and with the energy and fury
that so often go with red hair, the Redhead
jerked, shoved, and heaved, and the
brittle, red-topped toadstool broke in two
or three crisp pieces. As he sputtered
and Squirrel-cussed, there was a warning
Bluejay note. Redhead ran up the nearest
tree; as it happened, the one in which
was Bannertail, and in an instant the enemies
were face to face. "Scold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
fight" is the Redsquirrel's first impulse,
but when Bannertail rose up to full height
and spread his wondrous tail the Red one
was appalled. He knew his foe again; his
keen, discriminating nose got proofs of
that. The memory of defeat was with
him yet. He retreated, snick-sputtering,
and finally went wholly out of sight.</p>

<p>When all was still, Bannertail made his
way to the broken mushroom; rosy red
and beautiful its cap, snowy white its
stem and its crisp, juicy flesh.</p>

<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_168.jpg" width="219" height="174" alt="little man on toadstool" />
</div>

<p>But of this he took no count. The
smelling of it was his great chemic test.
It had the quaint, earthy odor of the little
ones he had seen before, and yet a
pungent, food-like smell, like butternuts,
indeed, with the sharp pepper tang of the
rind a little strong, and a whiff, too, of
the many-legged crawling things that he
had learned to shun. Still, it was alluring
as food. And now was a crucial time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
a veritable trail fork. Had Bannertail
been fed and full, the tiny little sense of
repulsion would have turned the scale,
would have reasserted and strengthened
the first true verdict of his guides&mdash;"Bad,
let it alone." But it had an attractive
nut-like aroma that was sweetly appetizing,
that set his mouth a-watering; and
this thing turned the scale&mdash;he was hungry.</p>

<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_169.jpg" width="164" height="242" alt="smoking pipe" />
</div>

<p>He nibbled and liked it, and nibbled
yet more. And though it was a big,
broad mushroom, he stopped not till it all
was gone. Food, good food it surely was.
But it was something more; the weird
juices that are the earth-child's blood entered
into him and set the fountains of
his life force playing with marvellous
power. He was elated. He was full of
fight. He flung out a defiant "<i>Qua!</i>" at
a Hen-hawk flying over. He rummaged
through the pines to find that fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Redsquirrel. He leaped tree gaps that he
would not at another time have dared.
Yes, and he fell, too; but the ample silver
plume behind was there to land him softly
on the earth. He made a long, far, racing
journey, saw hills and woods that were
new to him. He came to a big farmhouse
like the one his youth had known, but
passed it by, and galloped to another hillside.
From the top of a pine he vented
his wild spirits in a boisterous song&mdash;the
song of spring and fine weather, and the
song of autumn time and vigor.</p>

<p>The sun was low when, feeling his elation
gone, feeling dumb and drowsy, indeed,
he climbed the homestead tree and
glided into the old Hawk nest to curl in
his usual place beside his family.</p>

<p>Silvergray sniffed suspiciously; she
smelled his whiskers, she nibble-nibbled
with tongue and lips at the odd-smelling
specks of whitish food on his coat, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
juices staining his face and paws. New
food; it was strange, but pleased her not.
A little puzzled, she went to sleep, and
Bannertail's big tail was coverlet for all
the family.</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>THE sun came up, with its joyous
wakening of the woods.
All the Squirrel world was
bright and alert&mdash;all but
one. Mother went forth to
the sun-up meal, Brownhead went rollicking
forth, and Nyek-nyek went gliding,
too. But Bannertail lay still. He had
no words to state his case; he did not
know that he had a case to state. He
only knew that he was dull and sad, and
did not feel the early morning call of joy.
The juices of his weird feast were dried on
paws and head, and the smell of them,
though faint, was nauseating to him.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_177.jpg" width="154" height="319" alt="mushrooms" />
</div>
<p>He did not move that day; he had no
desire to move. The sun was low when
at length he went forth and down. At
the crystal spring he drank deep and
drank again. Silvergray licked his fur
when he came back with the youngsters
to the nest. He was better now, and
next sun-up was himself again, the big,
boisterous, rollicking Squirrel of the
plumy tail, the playmate of the young
ones, the husband of his wife. And their
merry lives went on, till one morning, on
the bank of the creek that flowed from
the high hill-country, he found a tiny,
shiny fragment of the weird spellbinding
mushroom. A table scrap, no doubt,
flood-borne from a Redhead feast. He
sniffed, as he sniffed all new, strange
things. A moon back it would have
been doubtful or repellent, but he had
closed his ears to the first warning of the
inner guide; so the warning now was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
low. He had yielded to the slight appetite
for this weird taste, so that appetite
was stronger. He eagerly gobbled the
shining, broken bit, and, possessed of
keen desire for more, went bounding and
pausing and fluffing, farther, farther off,
nor stopped till once more high in the
hill-country, among the pines and the
banks where the toadstools of black
magic grew.</p>



<p>Very keen was Bannertail when he
swung from the overhead highway of the
pines to the ground, to gallop over banks
with nose alert. Nor had he far to go.
This was toadstool time, and a scattered
band of these embodied earth-sprites was
spotting a sunlit bank with their smooth
and blushing caps.</p>

<p>Was there in his little soul still a warning
whisper? Yes. Just a little, a final,
feeble "Beware, touch it not!"&mdash;very
faint compared with the first-time warning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and now to be silenced by counter-doings,
just as a single trail in the sand
is wholly blotted out by a later trail
much used that goes counterwise across
it.</p>

<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_179.jpg" width="169" height="235" alt="Bannertail chasing" />
</div>

<p>Just a little pause made he, when the
sick smell of the nearest toadstool was felt
and measured by his nose. The lust for
that strong foody taste was overdominating.
He seized and crunched and revelled
in the flowing juices and the rank
nut taste, the pepper tang, the toothsome
mouthiness, and gobbled with growing
unreined greed, not one, but two or three&mdash;he
gorged on them; and though stuffed
and full, still filled with lust that is to
hunger what wounding is to soft caress.
He rushed from one madcap toadstool to
another, driving in his teeth, revelling in
their flowing juices, like the blood of
earthy gnomes, and rushed for joy up one
tall tree after another. Then, sensing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Redsquirrels, pursued them in a sort of
berserker rage, eager for fight, desperate
fight, any fight, fight without hate, that
would outlet his dangerous, boiling power,
his overflow of energy. Joy and power
were possessing his small brain and lusty
frame. He found another bank of madcap
cups; he was too gorged to eat them,
but he tossed and chewed the juicy cups
and stems. He raced after a fearsome
Water-snake on a sunny bank, and,
scared by the fury of his onslaught, the
Snake slipped out of sight. He galloped
up a mighty pine-tree, on whose highest
limbs were two great Flickers, clacking.
He chased them recklessly, then, clinging
to a bark flake that proved loose, he was
launched into the air, a hundred feet to
fall. But his glorious tail was there to
serve, and it softly let him down to earth.
It was well for him that he met no cat
or dog that day, for the little earth-born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
demon in his soul had cast out fear as
well as wisdom.</p>

<p>And Mother Carey must have wept as
she saw this very dear one take into his
body and his brain a madness that would
surely end his life. She loved him, but
far more she loved his race. And just a
little longer she would wait, and give him
yet one chance. And if he willed not to
be strong, then must he pay the price.</p>

<p>Not happy was his homecoming that
night. Silvergray sniffed at his whiskers.
She liked not his breath. There was no
kindness in her voice, her only sound a
harsh, low "<i>Grrrff!</i>"</p>

<p>And the family life went on.</p>

she only had a

repulsion, and an innate hatred

understand, but something there was
about their father these times that made
them much afraid.</div>

<p>They knew only the sorrow of it. They
had no knowledge of how it came or how

is the All-Mother, Mother Carey,
the wise one who seeks to have her strong
ones build the race. Twice had she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
warned him. Now he should have one
more chance.</p>



<p>The Thunder-moon, July, was dominating
Jersey woods, when the lusty life
force of the father Graycoat inevitably
sent him roving to the woods of the madcaps.
Plenty they were now, and many
had been stored by the Redsquirrels for
winter use, for this is the riddle of their
being, that the Redsquirrels long ago
have learned. On the bank, when they
are rooted in the earth, their juices from
the underworld are full of diabolic subtlety,
are tempting in the mouth as they
are deadly in the blood and sure destruction
at the last. They must be uprooted,
carried far from the ground and
the underground, and high hung in the
blessed purifying pine tops, where Father
Sun can burn away their evil. There,
after long months of sun and wind and
rain purgation, their earth-born bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
are redeemed, are wholesome Squirrel
food. This was the lesson Mother Carey
had taught the Redheads, for their country
is the country of the fool-trap toadstools.
But the Graycoats know it not.
And Bannertail came again.</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>THE wise men tell us that it is
the same as the venom of
Snakes. They tell us that
it comes when the fool-trap
toadstool is grown stale, and
by these ye may know its hidden presence:
When the cap is old and upturned at the
edge, when hell-born maggots crawl and
burrow and revel in the stem, when drops
of gummy, poisonous yellow blood ooze
forth, when both its smells&mdash;the warning
smell of the crawling hundred-legger and
the alluring smell of strong green butternuts&mdash;are
multiplied to fourfold power.</div>


<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_194.jpg" width="94" height="563" alt="monsters" />
</div>
<p>Their day was nearly over. They were
now like old worn hags, whose beauty is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
gone, and with it their power to please&mdash;hags
who have become embittered and
seek only to destroy. So the fool-trap
toadstools waited, silently as hunters'
deadfalls wait, until the moment comes
to strike.</p>



<p>It was the same sweet piny woods, the
same bright sparkling stream, and the
Song-hawk wheeled and sang the same
loud song, as Bannertail came once again
to seek his earth-born food, to gratify his
growing lust.</p>

<p>And Mother Carey led him on.</p>

<p>Plentifully strewn were the unholy
madcaps, broad bent and wrinkled now,
their weird aroma stronger and to a morbid
taste more alluring. Even yet a tiny
warning came as he sniffed their rancid,
noxious aura. The nut allurement, too,
was strong, and Bannertail rejoiced.</p>

<p>The feast was like the other, but
shorter, more restrained. There were little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
loathsome whiffs and acrid hints that
robbed it of its zest. Long before half a
meal, the little warden that dwells somewhere
betwixt mouth and maw began to
send offensive messages to his brain, and
even with a bite between his teeth there
set in strong a fearful devastating revulsion,
a climax of disgust, a maw-revolt,
an absolute loathing.</p>

<p>His mouth was dripping with its natural
juice, something gripped his throat,
the last morsel was there and seemed to
stick. He tight closed his eyes, violently
shook his head. The choking lump was
shaken out. Pains shot through his
body. Limbs and lungs were cramped.
He lay flat on the bank with head down-hill.
He jerked his head from side to
side with violent insistence. His stomach
yielded most of the fateful mass. But the
poison had entered into his body, already
was coursing in his veins.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Writhing with agony, overwhelmed
with loathing, he lay almost as dead, and
the smallest enemy he ever had might
now and easily have wreaked the limit of
revenge. It was accident so far as he
was concerned that made him crawl into a
dense thicket and like dead to lie all that
day and the night and the next day.
And dead he would have been but for the
unusual vigor of his superb body. Good
Mother Carey kept his enemies away.</p>

<p>Back at the home nest the mate and
family missed him, not much or pointedly,
as would folk of a larger brain and
life, but they missed him; and from the
tall, smooth shaft that afternoon the little
mother sent a long "<i>qua</i>" call. But
there was no answering "<i>qua</i>." She had
no means of knowing; she had no way of
giving help had she known.</p>

<p>The sun was low on Jersey hills that
second day when poor broken Bannertail,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
near-dead Bannertail, came to himself,
his much-enfeebled self. His head was
throbbing, his body was cramped with
pain, his mouth was dry and burning.
Down-hill he crawled and groped slowly
to the running stream and drank. It revived
him a little, enough so he could
crawl up the bank and seek a dry place
under a log to lie in peace&mdash;sad, miserable,
moaning peace.</p>

<p>Three days he suffered there, but the
fever had turned on that first night; from
the moment of that cooling drink he was
on the mend. For food he had no wish,
but daily and deeply he drank at the
stream.</p>

<p>On that third day he was well enough
to scramble up the hill; he passed a scattering
group of the earthy madcaps. Oh,
how he loathed them; their very smell set
his mouth a-dripping, refusing its own
proper juice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 253px;">

</div>

<p>Good things there were to eat on the
ground, but he had little appetite, though
for three days he had not eaten. He
passed by fat white grubs and even nuts,
but when he found some late wild strawberries
he munched them eagerly. Their
acid sweetness, their fragrant saneness,
were what his poor sick body craved. He
rested, then climbed a leaning tree. He
had not strength for a real climb. In an
old abandoned Flicker hole he curled himself
in safety, and strong, gentle Mother
Nature, Mother Carey, loving ever the
brave ones that never give up, now spread
her kindly influence, protecting, round
about him and gave him blessed, blessed
sleep.</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>IT was late on that fourth
day when Bannertail awoke.
He was a little better now.
He slowly went down that
tree, tail first; very sick, indeed,
is a Squirrel when he goes down a
tree tail first. Sweet, cooling water was
his need, and again a fragrant meal of the
tonic strawberries; then back to the tree.</div>



<p>Next day he was up with the morning
Robins, and now was possessed of the impulse
to go home. Vague pictures of his
mate and little ones, and the merry home
tree, came on his ever-clearer brain. He
set out with a few short hops, as he used
to go, and, first sign of sanity, he stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
to fluff his tail. He noticed that it was
soiled with gum. Nothing can dethrone
that needful basic instinct to keep in
order and perfect the tail. He set to
work and combed and licked each long
and silvered hair; he fluffed it out and
tried its billowy beauty, and having made
sure of its perfect trim he kept on, cleaned
his coat, combed it, went to the brook-side
and washed his face and paws clean
of every trace of that unspeakable stuff,
and in the very cleansing gave himself
new strength. Sleek and once more
somewhat like himself he was, when on
he went, bounding homeward with not
short bounds, but using every little lookout
on the way to peer around and fluff
and jerk his tail.</p>

<p>Back at the home tree at last, nearly
seven suns had come and gone since the
family had seen him.</p>



<p>The first impulse of the little mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
was hostility. A stranger is always a
hostile in the woods. But he flicked the
white flag on his tail tip, and slowly
climbed the tree. The youngsters in
alarm had hidden in the nest at mother's
"<i>Chik, chik</i>." She came cautiously forward.
His looks were familiar yet
strange. Here now was the time to use
caution. He swung up nearly to the
door. She stood almost at bay, uttered
a little warning "<i>Ggrrrfffhh</i>." He
crawled up closer. She spread her legs,
clutched firmly on the bark above him.
He wigwagged his silver tail-tip and,
slowly drawing nearer, reached out.
Their whiskers met; she sniffed, smell-tested
him. No question now. A little
changed, a little strange, but this was
surely her mate. She wheeled and went
into the nest. He came more slowly after,
put in his head, gave a low, soft "<i>Er</i>."
There was no reply and no hostile move.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
He crawled right in, his silver plume was
laid about them all, and the reunited family
slept till the hour arrived for evening
meal.</p>

</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THIS is the law of the All-Mother,
the more immovable
because unwritten; this
is the law of surfeit.</div>

<p>Many foods there are
which are wholesome, except that they
have in them a measure of poison.</p>

<p>For these the All-Mother has endowed
the wild things' bodies with a subtle antidote,
which continues self-replenishing
so long as the containing flask is never
wholly emptied. But if it so chance that
in some time of fearful stress the flask is
emptied, turned upside down, drained
dry, it never more will fill. The small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
alembic that distils it breaks, as a boiler
bursts if it be fired while dry. Thenceforth
the toxin that it overcame has virulence
and power; that food, once wholesome,
is a poison now.</p>

<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_208.jpg" width="166" height="182" alt="squirrel eating" />
</div>

<p>A "surfeit" men call this breaking of
the flask; all too well is it known. By
this, unnumbered healthful foods&mdash;strawberries,
ice-cream, jam, delicate meat,
eggs, yes, even simple breads can by the
devastating drain of one rash surfeit be
turned into very foods of death. The
poison always was there, but the secret,
neutralizing chemical is gone, the elixir is
destroyed, and by the working of the law
its deadly power is loosed. As poor second
now to this lost and subtle protection,
the All-Mother endows the body
with another, one of a lower kind. She
makes that food so repellent to the unwise,
punished creature that he never
more desires it. She fills him with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
fierce repulsion, the bodily rejection that
men call "nausea."</p>

<p>This is the law of surfeit. Bannertail
had fallen foul of it, and Mother Carey,
loving him as she ever loves her strong
ones, had meted out the fullest measure
of punishment that he, with all his
strength, could bear and yet come through
alive.</p>

<p>The Red Moon of harvest was at hand.
The Graycoat family was grown, and
happy in the fulness of their lives, and
Bannertail was hale and filled with the
joy of being alive, leading his family beyond
old bounds, teaching them the ways
of the farther woods, showing them new
foods that the season brings. He, wise
leader now, who once had been so unwise.
Then Mother Carey put him to
the proof. She led, he led them farther
than they had ever gone before, to the remotest
edge of the hickory woods. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
a bank half sunlit as they scampered
over the leaves and down the logs, he
found a blushing, shining gnome-cap, an
earth-born madcap. Yes, the very same,
for in this woods they came, though they
were rare. One whiff, one identifying
sniff of that Satanic exhalation, and Bannertail
felt a horrid clutching at his throat,
his lips were quickly dripping, his belly
heaved, he gave a sort of spewing, gasping
sound, and shrank back from that
shining cap with eyes that bulged in hate,
as though he saw a Snake. There is no
way of fully telling his bodily revulsion.
The thing that once was so alluring, was
so loathsome that he could not stand its
fetid odor on the wind. And the young
ones were caught by the unspoken horror
of the moment, they took it in; they got
the hate sense. They tied up that horror
in their memories with that rank and
sickly smell. They turned away, Bannertail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
to drink in the running brook, to
partly forget in a little while, yet never
quite to forget. He was saved, the great
All-Mother had saved him, which was a
good thing, but not in itself a great thing.
This was the great thing, that in that
moment happened&mdash;the loathing of the
earth-born fiend was implanted in his
race, and through them would go on to
bless his generations yet to be.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SQUIRREL GAMES</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_g.jpg" width="110" height="109" alt=""/>
</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>GAMES are used among wild
animals for the training of
the young. King of the
castle, tag, hide-and-seek,
follow-my-leader, catch-as-catch-can,
wrestling, coasting, high-dive,
and, in rare cases, even ball games are
enjoyed. Most of them were in some
sort played by the young Squirrels. But
these are world-wide, they had one or
two that were peculiarly their own, and
of these the most exciting was the dangerous
game of "teasing the Hawk."</div>

<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_215.jpg" width="285" height="107" alt="playing catch" />
</div>

<p>Three kinds of big Hawks there are in
the Squirrel woods in summertime: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Hen-hawk that commonly sails high in
the air, screaming or whistling, and that
at other times swoops low and silent
through the woods, and always is known
by his ample wings and bright red tail;
the gray Chicken-hawk that rarely soars,
but that skims among the trees or even
runs on the ground, whose feathers are
gray-brown, and whose voice is a fierce
<i>crek, crek, creek</i>; and the Song-hawk or
Singer, who is the size of the Chicken-hawk,
but a harmless hunter of mice and
frogs, and known at all seasons by the
stirring song that he pours out as he
wheels like a Skylark high in the blue.</p>

<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_216.jpg" width="188" height="308" alt="hawk on branch" />
</div>

<p>The inner guide had warned the boisterous
Bannertail to beware of all of them.
Experience taught him that they will attack,
and yet are easily baffled, if one
does but slip into a hole or thicket, or
even around the bole of a tree.</p>

<p>Many times that summer did Bannertail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
avoid the charge of Redtail or Chicken-hawk
by the simple expedient of going
through a fork or a maze of branches.
There was no great danger in it, as long
as he kept his head; and it did not disturb
him, or cause his heart a single extra
beat. It became a regular incident in
his tree-top life, just as a stock man is
accustomed to the daily danger of a savage
Bull, but easily eludes any onset by
slipping through a fence. It does not
cause him a tremor, he is used to it; and
men there are who make a sport of it,
who love to tease the Bull, who enjoy his
helpless rage as he vainly tries to follow.
His mighty strength is offset by their
cunning and agility. It is a pretty match,
a very ancient game, and never quite
loses zest, because the Bull does sometimes
win; and then there is one less
Bull-teaser on the stock-range.</p>

<p>This was the game that Bannertail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
evolved. Sure of himself, delighting in
his own wonderful agility, he would often
go out to meet the foe, if he saw the Hen-hawk
or the Chicken-hawk approaching.
He would flash his silver tail, and shrill
"<i>Grrrff, grrrff</i>," by way of challenge.</p>

<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_218.jpg" width="158" height="291" alt="flying hawk" />
</div>

<p>The Hen-hawk always saw. "Keen-eyed
as a hawk" is not without a reason.
And, sailing faster than a driving leaf, he
would swish through the hickory woods
to swoop at the challenging Squirrel.
But just as quick was Bannertail, and
round the rough trunk he would whisk,
the Hawk, rebounding in the air to save
himself from dashing out his brains or
being impaled, would now be greeted on
the other side by the head and flashing
tail of the Squirrel, and another with loud,
defiant "<i>Ggrrrffhh, grggrrrffhh</i>."</p>

<p>Down again would swoop the air bandit,
quicker than a flash, huge black claws
advanced, and Bannertail would wait till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the very final instant, rejoicing in his
every nerve at tension, and just as those
deadly grappling-irons of the Hawk were
almost at his throat, he would duck,
the elusive, baffling tail would flash in
the Hawk's very face, and the place the
Graycoat had occupied on the trunk was
empty. The grapnels of the Hawk
clutched only bark; and an instant later,
just above, the teasing head and the
flaunting tail of Bannertail would reappear,
with loudly voiced defiance.</p>

<p>The Hawk, like the Bull, is not of
gentle humor. He is a fierce and angry
creature, out to destroy; his anger grows
to fury after such defeat, he is driven
wild by the mockery of it, and oftentimes
he begets such a recklessness that
he injures himself by accident, as he
charges against one of the many sharp
snags that seem ever ready for the Squirrel-kind's
defense.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, a good old game it is, with the
zest of danger strong. But there is another
side to it all.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="113" height="112" alt=""/>
</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>IT makes indeed merry play,
with just enough of excitement
when you bait the
Bull, and dodge back to the
fence to laugh at his impotent
raging. But it makes a very different
chapter when a second Bull comes
on the other side of the fence. Then the
game is over, the Bull-baiter must find
some far refuge or scramble up the nearest
sheltering tree, or pay the price.</div>
<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_224.jpg" width="250" height="80" alt="landscape" />
</div>
<p>Bannertail had an ancient feud with
the big Hen-hawk, whose stick nest was
only a mile away, high in a rugged beech.
There were a dozen farmyards that paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
unwilling tribute to that Hawk, a hundred
little meadows with their Mice and
Meadowlarks, and one open stretch of
marsh with its Muskrats and its Ducks.
But the hardwood ridges, too, he counted
on for dues. The Squirrels all were his,
if only he could catch them. Many a
game had he and Bannertail, a game
of life and death.</p>


<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_226.jpg" width="128" height="158" alt="squirrel in long wrap like a cloak" />
</div>

<p>They played again that morning in
July. It was the same old swooping of
the whistling pinions, and the grasping of
strong yellow feet with hard black claws,
grasping at nothing, where was a Graycoat
half a heartbeat back, the same
flaunting silver flag, the mocking "<i>Grrrff,
grrrff</i>," the teasing and daring of the
Hawk to make another swoop. Then
did that big Hen-hawk what he should
have done before. He filled the air with
his war-cry, the long screaming "<i>Yek-yek-yeeeek!</i>"
Coursing low and swift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
came another, his mate, the lady bandit,
even fiercer than himself. Swift and with
little noise she came. And when savage
old Yellow-eyes swooped and Bannertail
whisked around the tree, he whisked
right into the clutches of the deadlier
she-one. He barely escaped by a marvellous
side rush around the trunk. Here
again was Yellow-eyes, but right in his
face Bannertail dashed his big silvery
tail. The Hawk in his haste clutched at
its nothingness, or he would have got the
Graycoat. But luck was with Bannertail,
and again he dodged around the
trunk. Alas, the she Hawk was there,
and struck; her mighty talons grazed his
haunch, three rips they made in his
glossy, supple coat. In an instant more
the Redtail would have trussed him, for
there was no cover, only the big, outstanding
trunk, with the Hen-hawks
above and below. A moment more and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Bannertail's mate, helpless in the distant
nest, would have seen him borne away.
But as they closed, he leaped&mdash;leaped
with all his strength, far from them into
open air, and faster than they could fly
in such a place, down, down, his silver
plume in function just behind him, down
a hundred feet to fall and land in a
thicket of laurel, wounded and bleeding,
but safe. He scrambled into a thicker
maze, and gazed with new and tenser
feelings at the baffled Hen-hawks, circling,
screaming high above him.</p>


<p>Soon the bandits gave up. Clearly the
Graycoat had won, and they flew to levy
their robber-baron tribute on some others
that they held to be their vassals.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;">
<img src="images/i_226fp.jpg" width="392" height="584" alt="teasing a hawk again" />
<span class="caption">A DANGEROUS GAME</span>
</div>

<p>Yes, Bannertail had won, by a narrow
lead. He had taken a mighty hazard and
had learned new wisdom&mdash;Never play
the game with death till you have to, for
if you win one hundred times and lose
once you have lost your whole stake.
On his haunch he carried, carries yet,
the three long scars, where the fur is a
little paler&mdash;the brand of the robber
baroness, the slash of the claws that
nearly got him.</p>

<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_227.jpg" width="159" height="143" alt="taking a flying leap" />
</div>

<p>Have you noted that in the high Alleghenies,
where the Graycoats seldom see
hunters of any kind, they scamper while
the enemy is far away; but they peer
from upper limbs and call out little challenges?
In Jersey woods, where a wiser
race has come, they never challenge a
near foe; they make no bravado rushes.
They signal if they see an enemy near,
then hide away in perfect stillness till
that enemy, be it Hawk in air or Hound
on earth, is far away, or in some sort
ceases to be a menace.</p>

<p>And menfolk hunters, who tell of their
feats around the glowing stove in the winter-time,
say there is a new race of Graycoats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a><br /><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
come. Any gunner could kill one
of the old sort, but it takes a great
hunter such as themselves to get one of
the new. This latter-day Graycoat has
gotten much wisdom into his little brain,
and one of the things he knows: "It
never pays to gamble with destruction."</p>

<p>The new race, they say, began in a
certain hickory wood. We know that
wood, and we have seen a little how the
wisdom came, and can easily reason why
it spread.</p>

</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>NEXT in importance to the
Squirrels, after the towering
trees with their lavish
bounty, was the brook that
carried down scraps of the
blue sky to inlay them with green moss,
purple logs, and gold-brown stones, that
sang its low, sweet song both day and
night, and that furnished to the family
their daily drink.</div>

<p>"Do not drink at the pond" is a Squirrel
maxim, for in it lurks the fearful Snapping
Turtle and the grinning Pike. Its
banks are muddy, too, and the water
warm. It is better to drink from some
low log, along the brook itself.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 245px;">
<img src="images/i_231.jpg" width="245" height="67" alt="pike" />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>And do not drink in the blinding sunlight,
which makes it hard to see if danger
is near; then, too, it is that the Blacksnake
crawls out to seek some basking
place in the hottest sun.</p>

<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_232.jpg" width="242" height="103" alt="blacksnake" />
</div>

<p>Yes, this is Squirrel wisdom; the morning
drink is at sunrise, the evening at
sunset, when the cool shade is on the
woods but darkness not begun.</p>

<p>The Graycoat family held together still,
though the Harvest-moon was red in the
low eastern sky. Some Squirrel families
break up as soon as the young are nearly
grown. But some there are that are held
together longer, very long, by unseen
bonds of sympathy with which they have
been gifted in a little larger measure than
is common. Brownhead was much away,
living his own life. Still, he came home.
Nyek-nyek, gentle, graceful Nyek-nyek,
clung to her mother and the old nest, like
a very weanling; and rest assured that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Squirrel-land, as in others, love is begotten
and intensified by love.</p>

<p>The morning drink and the morning
meal were the established daily routine.
Then came a time of exercise and play.
But all Squirrels that are hale and wise
take a noonday nap.</p>

<p>Each was stretched on one or other of
the sleeping platforms, lying lazily at
ease one noontime. The day was very
hot, and the sun swung round so it glared
on Nyek-nyek's sleeping-porch. Panting
soon with the heat, she decided to drink,
swung to the gangway of their huge trunk
and started down the tree. The little
mother, ever alert, watched the young
one go. There was in her heart just a
shadow of doubt, of distrust, much as a
human mother might feel if she saw her
toddler venture forth alone into the
night.</p>

<p>Nyek-nyek swung to the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
coursed in billowy ripples of silver-gray
along a log, stopped on a stump to look
around and religiously fluff her tail, while
mother dreamily watched through half-closed
eyes. Then out into the brilliant
sunlight she went. Some creatures are
dazed and made lazy by the hot, bright
glare, some find in it a stimulant, a multiplier
of their life force; it sets their senses
on a keener edge; it gifts them with new
speed, intensifies their every power.</p>

<p>The Graycoats are of the first kind,
and of the second was Coluber, the long,
black, shiny, blue-black Snake that was
lying like a limp and myriad-linked chain
flung across a big, low log&mdash;a log that
sucked the sun heat as it lay, just where
the brook expanded to the pond. Never
a blink was there in those gray-green eyes,
never a quiver in that long, lithe tongue.
One not knowing would have said he is
dead; one knowing him well would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
said he is filling up his storage-batteries
to the full. Never a wriggle was there in
even the nervous tail tip, that nearly always
switches to and fro; yet not a move
of the Squirrel since she left her sleeping
porch was lost on him.</p>

<p>What was it gave a new pathway to
the young Graycoat? Was it Mother
Carey who led her with a purpose? Not
to the familiar log she went, where the
family had always found an ideal footing
when they took the morning drink, but
down-stream, toward the pond and on to
the little muddy shore.</p>

<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_236.jpg" width="147" height="204" alt="snake with wide open mouth" />
</div>

<p>The mother Squirrel saw that, and her
feeling of doubt grew stronger. She rose
up to follow, but gazed a moment to see
a sudden horror. Just as the little Nyek-nyek
stooped and sank her face deep to
her eyes in the cooling flood, the Blacksnake
sprang, sprang from his coil as a
Blacksnake springs, when the victim is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
within the measured length. Sprang with
his rows of teeth agape, clinched on her
neck, and in a trice the heavy coils, tense
with energy, ridged with muscle, flash-lapped
around her neck and loins, gripped
in an awful grip, while the lithe, live scaly
tail wrapped round a branch to anchor
both killer and victim to the place. One
shriek of "<i>Qua</i>," another fainter, and a
final gasp, and no more sound from Nyek-nyek.
But she struggled, a hopeless,
helpless struggle. The mother saw it all.
Fear of that terrible Snake was forgotten.
Not one moment did she pause. She did
not clamber down that tree. She leaped
to the next and a lower yet, and along a
log; five heart-beats put her on the spot;
and with all her force she drove her teeth
into the hard, scaly coil of the beast that
she held in mortal fear. With a jerk the
monster quit his neck hold on the young
one. She was helpless, bound in his coil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
and the Snake's dread jaws with the rows
of pointed teeth clamped on the mother's
neck, and another fold of that long, hellish
length was hitched around her throat.
Scratch she could and struggle, but bite
she could not, for the coil held her as in
a vise. For a moment only could she
make a sound, the long, long, screaming
"<i>Queeee</i>," the Squirrel call for help; and
Bannertail, lazily dozing on his sunning
perch, sprang up and set his ears acock.</p>

<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_237.jpg" width="195" height="404" alt="Squirrel looking down" />
</div>

<p>It was not repeated, but the sound of
struggle was there, and the keen-eyed
father Squirrel saw the flash of a silver
tail, the signal of his kind. And from
that perch high in the air he leaped in one
long, parachuting leap; he landed on the
ground, and in three mighty bounds he
was at the place. The horror of the
Snake was on him. It set his coat a-bristling;
but it did not hold him back.
It only added desperation to his onset.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Clutching that devilish scaly neck with
both his arms, he drove in his chisel teeth
and ground them in, down to the very
bone, as Silvergray could not have done.
He worked and tugged and stabbed again,
and the Snake, sensing a new and stronger
foe, relaxed on Silvergray, snapped with
his hateful jaws, seized Bannertail's
strong shoulder just where he best could
stand it&mdash;where the skin is thick and
strong the Blacksnake drove in and
gripped. And Bannertail, as quick, quit
his first hold on the coil that was strangling
Nyek-nyek, and by good luck, or
maybe by better wisdom than his own,
drove, fighting fierce, into the demon's
throat, the weak spot in that scaly armor.
Deep sank the Squirrel's teeth, and pangs
of mortal agony went thrilling through
the reptile's length. But he was strong,
and a desperate fighter, too. The coils
unloosed on the senseless form of Nyek-nyek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and lapped in a trice on Bannertail,
three times round, straining, crushing,
while his rows of cruel fangs were sunk
in the Squirrel's silvery side.</p>

<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_239.jpg" width="176" height="155" alt="knight killing dragon" />
</div>

<p>But in throwing all his force against
Bannertail he released the little Gray
mother. She flung herself again on the
black horror, and bit with all her power
the head that was gripped on the shoulder
of her mate. Very narrow is the demon
reptile's head, and only one place was
open, offered to her grip. She bit with
all her force across the eyes, her long,
sharp chisels entered in. His eyes were
pierced, his brain was stung. With an
agonizing last convulsion he wrenched on
Bannertail, then, quivering with a palsy
that changed to a springing open of the
coils, he dashed his head from side to
side, lashed his tail, heaved this way and
that, coiled up, then straightened out.
The Squirrels leaped back, the monster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
lashed in writhing convolutions, felt the
cool water that he could no longer see,
went squirming out upon it, working
his frothy jaws, lashing, thrashing with
his tail. Then up from the darkest depths
came a hideous goggle-eyed head, a monstrous
head, as big as a Squirrel's whole
body, and on it a horny beak, which,
opening, showed a huge red maw, and the
squirming Blacksnake was seized by the
bigger brute. Crushed and broken in
those mighty jaws was the Black One's
supple spine; torn open by those great
claws was his belly, ended was his life.
The Snapper sank, taking the Blacksnake
with him. It was the finish of an ancient
feud between them, and down in the dark
depths of the pond the Water Demon
feasted on the body of his foe.</p>

<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_240.jpg" width="168" height="99" alt="snapper attacking snake" />
</div>

<p>And Bannertail, the brave fighter, with
the heroic little Mother and Nyek-nyek
now revived, drew quickly back to safety.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
A little cut they were, but mostly breathless,
their very wind squeezed out by
those dread coils. The ripples on the
pool had scarcely died before they were
all three again in the dear old nest, with
Brownhead back anew from a far journey.
Without words, were they to tell of their
thrills and fears, or their joy; but this reaction
came: They cuddled up in the nest,
a little closer than before, a little more at
one, a little less to feel the scatteration
craze that comes in most wild families
when the young are grown; which meant
these young will have for a little longer
the good offices of their parents, and are
thereby fitted a little better for the life-battle,
a little more likely to win.</p>

<p>Is it not by such accumulating little
things that brain and brawn and the
world success of every dominating race of
creatures has been built?</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>THAT was the year of the
wonderful nut crop. It is
commonly so; the year of
famine is followed by one of
plenty. Red oaks and white
were laden, as well as the sweet shag
hickories. And the Bannertail family in
their grove watched with a sort of owner
pride the thick green hanging clusters of
their favorite food.</div>

<div class="image-right">

</div>

<p>Like small boys too eager to await
the baking of their cake, nibbling at the
unsatisfactory half-done dough, they cut
and opened many a growing nut. Its
kernel, very small as yet, was good; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the rind, oozing its green-brown juices,
stained their jaws and faces, yes,&mdash;their
arms and breasts, till it was hard to
recognize each other in these dark-brown
masks. For the disfigurement they cared
nothing. Only when the thick sap, half
drying, gummed his silvery plume, did
Bannertail abandon other pursuits to lick
and clear and thoroughly comb that priceless
tail; and what he did, the others, by
force of his energetic example, were soon
compelled to do.</p>

<p>The Hunting-moon, September, came.
The nuts were fully grown but very green.
"Who owns the nuts?" is an old question
in the woods. Usually they are owned
by the one who can possess them effectively,
although there are some restraining,
unwritten laws.</p>

<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_246.jpg" width="173" height="306" alt="squirrels carrying baskets on their heads" />
</div>

<p>Squirrels have three well-marked ideas
of property. First, of the nesting-place
which they have possessed, and the nest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
which they have built; second, the food
which they have found or stored; third,
the range which is their homeland&mdash;the
boundaries of which are not well-defined&mdash;but
most jealously held against those
of their own kind. The Homeland is
also held against all who eat their foods
so that it is part of the food-property
sense. All three were strong in Bannertail;
and his growing pride in the coming
nut yield was much like that of a farmer
who, by the luck of good weather, is
blessed with a bumper crop of corn.</p>

<p>It seemed as though word of the coming
feast had spread to other and far-off
places, for many other nut-eaters kept
drifting that way, turning up in the hickory
woods that the Graycoats thought
their own.</p>

<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_247.jpg" width="140" height="458" alt="woodpecker on three trunk" />
</div>

<p>The Bluejay and the Redheaded Woodpecker
came. They pecked long and hard
at the soggy husks to get at the soft,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
sweet, milk-white meat. They did little
damage, for their beaks were not strong
enough to twist off the nuts and carry
them away, but the Graycoats felt that
these were poachers and drove them off.
Of course it was easy for the birds to keep
out of reach, but they hovered about,
stealing&mdash;yes, that was what the Squirrels
thought about it&mdash;stealing the hickory
harvest when they could.</p>

<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_248.jpg" width="179" height="140" alt="bird flying with berry in beak" />
</div>

<p>Then came other poachers, the Redsquirrel
with his mate, cheeky, brazen-fronted,
aggressive as usual; they would
come quietly, when the Graycoats were
asleep or elsewhere, and proceed to cut
the nut bunches. Many times the only
notice of their presence was the sudden
"thump, thump" of the nut bunch striking
the ground after the Red One had cut
it loose. His intention had been to go
down quietly after it, split the husks, and
carry off the luscious, half-ripe nuts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
his storehouse. But the racket called the
Graycoats' attention. Bannertail and
Brownhead would rush forth like settlers
to fight off an Indian raid, or like householders
to save their stuff from burglars.</p>

<p>There was little actual fighting to do
with the Red Ones, for they had learned
to fear and fly from the Graycoats, but
they did not fly far. Their safest refuge
was a hole underground, where Graycoats
could not or would not follow, and after
waiting for quiet the Red Robber would
come out again, and sometimes, at least,
get away with a load of the prized nuts.</p>

<p>New enemies approached one day,
nothing less than other Graycoats, some
Squirrels of their own kind, travelling
from some other land, travelling, maybe,
like Joseph and his brethren, away from
a place of famine, till now they found
an Egypt, a land of plenty.</p>

<p>Against them Bannertail went vigorously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
to war. It is well known that the
lawful owner fights more valiantly, with
more heart, with indomitable courage
indeed, while the invader is in doubt.
He lacks the backing of a righteous cause.
He half expects to be put to flight, even
as he goes forth to battle. And the Bannertails
were able to make good their
claims to the hickory grove. Yet it kept
them ever alert, ever watchful, ever ready
to fight.</p>

<p>Partly because the nuts were already
good food, and partly because it kept
others from stealing them, the Graycoats
cut some of the crop in September.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="113" height="112" alt=""/>
</div><div class='drop-cap'>IN the Leaf-falling-moon,
October, the husks began to
dry and split, and the nuts
to fall of themselves. Then
was seen a wild, exciting
time, the stirring of habits and impulses
laid in the foundations of the race.</div>



<p>No longer wabbly or vague, as in that
first autumn, but fully aroused and dominating
was the instinct to gather and bury
every precious, separate nut. Bannertail
had had to learn slowly and partly
by seeing the Redsquirrels making off
with the prizes. But he had learned,
and his brood had the immediate stimulus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
of seeing him and their mother at work;
and because he was of unusual force, it
drove him hard, with an urge that acted
like a craze. He worked like mad, seizing,
stripping, smelling, appraising, marking,
weighing every nut he found.</p>
<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_254.jpg" width="210" height="219" alt="Mrs. Squirrel inspecing a nut" />
</div>



<p>What, weighing it? Yes, every nut
was weighed by the wise harvester.
How? By delicate muscular sense. It
was held for a moment between the paws,
and if it seemed far under weight it was
cast aside as worm-eaten, empty, worthless;
if big, but merely light in weight,
that meant probably a fat worm was within.
Then that nut was split open and the
worm devoured. A wormy nut was never
stored. If the nut was heavy, round, and
perfect, the fine balance in the paws and
the subtle sense of smell asserted the fact,
and then it was owner-marked. How?
By turning it round three times in the
mouth, in touch with the tongue. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
left the personal touch of that Squirrel on
it, and would protect it in a measure from
being carried off by other Graysquirrels,
especially when food abounded. Then,
rushing off several hops from the place
where the last nut was buried, Bannertail
would dig deep in the ground, his full
arm's length, ram down the nut held in
his teeth; then, pushing back the earth
with snout and paws, would tamp that
down, replacing the twigs and dry leaves
so the nut was safely hidden. Then to
the next, varying the exercise by dashing,
not after the visiting Graysquirrels&mdash;they
kept their distance&mdash;but after some
thieving Chipmunk or those pestiferous
Redsquirrels who sought sometimes to
unearth his buried treasure. Or, he would
dart noisily up the tree, to chase the
Bluejays who were trying to rob them of
the nuts not yet fallen; then back to earth
again, where was his family&mdash;Silvergray,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Brownhead, and Nyek-nyek&mdash;inspired
by his example, all doing as he did, working
like beavers, seizing, husking, weighing,
marking, digging, dig-dig-digging
and burying nuts all day long. Hundreds
of these little graves they dug, till the
ground under every parent tree was a living,
crowded burying-ground of the tree's
own children. Morning, noon, and evening
they worked, as long as there was
light enough to see.</p>
<div class="image-right">
<img src="images/i_255.jpg" width="180" height="235" alt="bunny reading a warning sign" />
</div>
<p>A cool night and another drying day
brought down another hickory shower.
And the Graycoats worked without ceasing.
They were tired out that night.
They had driven off a score of robbers,
they had buried at least a thousand nuts,
each in a separate hole. The next day
was an even more strenuous time. For
seven full days they worked, and then the
precious nut harvest was over. Acorns&mdash;red
and white and yellow&mdash;might come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
later, and some be buried and some not.
The Bluejays, Woodpeckers, and the Redsquirrels
would get a handsome share, and
pile them up in storehouses, a day's gathering
in one place, for such is their way,
but the hickory-nuts were the precious
things that counted for the Bannertail
brood. Ten thousand at least had the
Graycoats buried, each an arm's length
down, and deftly hidden, with the trash
of the forest floor replaced.</p>
<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/i_258.jpg" width="208" height="127" alt="oak leaves and acorns" />
</div>
<p>This undoubtedly was their only impulse,
to bury the rich nuts for future use
as food. But Nature's plan was larger.
There were other foods in the woods at
this season. The Squirrels would not
need the precious hickories for weeks or
months; all sign that might mark the
burial-place would be gone. When really
driven by need the Squirrels would come
and dig up these caches. Memory of the
locality first, then their exquisite noses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
would be their guides. They would find
most of the nuts again. But not all.
Some would escape the diggers, and what
would happen to these? <i>They would
grow.</i> Yes, that was Nature's plan. The
acorns falling and lying on the ground can
burst their thin coats, send down a root
and up a shoot at once, but the hickory
must be buried or it will dry up before it
grows. This is the hickory's age-old
compact with the Graysquirrel: You
bury my nuts for me, plant my children,
and you may have ninety-five per cent of
the proceeds for your trouble, so long only
as you save the other five per cent and
give them a chance to grow up into
hickory-trees.</p>



<p>This is the unwritten but binding bargain
that is observed each year. And
this is the reason why there are hickory-trees
wherever there are Graysquirrels.
Where the Graycoats have died out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
hickory's days are numbered. And foolish
man, who slays the Graysquirrel in his
reckless lust for killing, is also destroying
the precious hickory-trees, whose timber
is a mainstay of the nation-feeding agriculture
of the world. He is like the fool
on a tree o'erhanging the abyss, who saws
the very limb on which depends his life.</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>HIS race still lives in Jersey
woods; they have come back
into their own. Go forth, O
wise woodman, if you would
become yet wiser. Go in the
dew-time after rain, when the down, dry
leaves have lost their tongues. Go softly
as you may, you will see none of the Squirrel-kind,

"All's well!" is the word they are
passing, and if you continue very discreet

again. The silent trees will give up dryad
forms, not many, not hundreds, not even
scores, but a dozen or more, and they will
play and live their greenwood lives about
you, unafraid. They will come near, if
you still emanate unenmity, so you may
see clearly the liquid eyes, the vibrant
feelers on their legs and lips. And if these
be tree-top wood-folk, very big and strong
of their kind, with silvery coats and
brownie caps, and tails that are of marvellous
length and fluff, like puffs of yellow
smoke with silver frills or flashes of a
white light about them, then be sure of
